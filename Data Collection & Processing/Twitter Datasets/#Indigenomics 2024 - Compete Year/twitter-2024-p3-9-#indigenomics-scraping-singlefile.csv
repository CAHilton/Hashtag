Another 13 Moon Woman,@enrichedbycode,,"Another 13 Moon Woman@enrichedbycode14 Jun 2024The third attractor is#IndigenomicsüòçMichel Bauwens@mbauwens14 Jun 2024* Is the 'West' or 'Capitalism' solely responsible for the current environmental destruction ?

 It is now a given, for most people who are ecologically aware, that the above principle is evidently true. However, I would strongly dispute it. Civilizational history, and studies such as HANDY, show that every civilization, has in fact, destroyed its underlying territory, with very few exceptions. One that comes to mind is Togukawa Japan, which lived for nearly 2.5 centuries with a stable population and stable resources, but that is a huge outlier. Generally speaking, market-states institutions are extractive and competitive systems, which to maintain themselves are forces to hyper-extract from their environments.

What is different, and here the 'West' can be blamed, is that it uniquely created a dualist philosophy which completely abandoned the organicist ideologies which governed previous civilizational forms; and industrialism and later the welfare state compromise and its neoliberal successor, created higher and higher rates of extraction, which end up 'eating the world'. But not that every planetary nation, with very few exceptions, has gone in the same direction, they are not qualitative different.

Why does this matter ? Because simply returning to a pre-Western civilizational arrangement, would still mean a return to extractive dynamics, though at a lower scale. What this means is, rather than blaming the 'West', it is global capitalist modernity which is the culprit, and that we have to transcend it to post-capitalist, and I would dare say, post-civilizational forms of life.

Just as the biosphere moved from immature instability to a mature and stable form, creating human culture and its technosphere; just in the same way the current 'immature' technosphere, a global phenomena, needs to be transformed into a mature form, that can live for millions of years in a stable relation to the non-human world of life and 'resources'.

Western-bashing is not going to advance these types of solutions, if it is based on an idealization of non-western civilizational forms.

The crucial 'reform' is the creation of strong cosmo-local commons-centric protective and generative institutions, which combine differentialism (local cultural diversity, at different levels of scale) with an 'entangled' universalism, that has learned to include the non-human. The non-West is not doing that much better in its modern form, and the pre-industrial/cognitive modalities cannot deal with the current level of complexity.

Hence the need for a third attractor between chaos and tyranny: the commons-centric cosmo-local post-civilizational world order that we are co-constructing as we speak.111",Another 13 Moon Woman@enrichedbycode14 Jun 2024,The third attractor is#Indigenomicsüòç,14 Jun 2024,111,,
