#indigenomics #indigenomics | Jen Newsted,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jennewsted_indigenomics-indigenomics-activity-7237509771803664384-QyQ4,"Friends, and especially those in, around, or with connection to Winnipeg- are you registered for the upcoming Indigenomics SHE conference taking place September 23 &amp; 24 yet?

The reason I ask is because I get lots of asks from folks looking for connections or introductions to Indigenous folks that I might know. 

Here&#39;s the secret to you skipping the step of having to ask me who I know: Activate your reconciliation commitments by intentionally prioritizing getting yourself into spaces that are Indigenous led so that YOU are in fact doing the work to meet, connect, cultivate relationships with Indigenous leaders and businesses. 

The learning that comes from being in Indigenous led spaces, like the annual events the Indigenomics Institute hosts, are phenomenally rich and imperative for our reconciliation responsibility. But you know this because I have been telling you which is why you are reaching out to me. Remember this is our shared responsibility.

Indigenomics SHE has 40 Indigenous leaders who will share their insights, experiences, challenges, successes in government, law, finance, tech, education, communications, fashion, art, tourism, culinary, corporate canada, entrepreneurism.

The conference will be hosted and emceed again this year by three epic humans who are shining brightly in the image from last year&#39;s SHE conference. Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D, CEO and founder of Indigenomics Institute, Global Centre of Indigenomics &amp; the Global Indigenous Technology House, Ashley Richard Director, Indigenous Entrepreneurship University of Waterloo and Diane Roussin BA, BSW, M.S.M. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Project Director, The Winnipeg Boldness Project.

Keynotes are from Laurie Sterritt Managing Partner Pathways Executive Search and Victoria LaBillois, MBA owner of Wejipeg Excavation and founder Eloquent Hostess. 

Additionally, in the room are representatives from Women Entrepreneurship Knowledge Hub (WEKH), TELUS, Vancity, Alliance Trust Company, Calgary, Canada, BFL CANADA, RBCvely contributing to #Indigenomics as partners and sponsors.

Reconciliation is about relationships and relationships do not happen in documents collecting dust. Please get in this room AND bring your c-suite, your board members, your teams, your clients because my goodness the opportunities that we have to actually show up in reconciliation are abundant - shift status quo behaviour so you stop being the barrier of why you/your company&#39;s reconciliation isn&#39;t progressing. 

If you can&#39;t physically be there you can still contribute by committing to an Accessibility package that will allow for Indigenous folks to participate on your behalf. This is also how we start to cultivate relationships. 

Finally, here&#39;s another super simple way to action reconciliation: Copy the link below and put it in your newsletters. It isn&#39;t difficult friends, unless we make it. 

I hope I see you in Winnipeg for #Indigenomics

At the same time its crucial to acknowledge the irony: White settlers stole the land from Indigenous Peoples, exploited it for profit by repeatedly cutting down trees, which damaged watersheds and pushed many species to the brink of extinction. Now, as these lands become less profitable, we pat ourselves on the back for &#39;buying it back&#39; only to return the land in a degraded state for healing through Indigenous Stewardship.

It didn&#39;t take long before I leapt towards Carol Anne Hilton, MBA&#39;s ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Indigenomics ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ taking a seat at the tableï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and finally got around to reading it this weekend. 

If Economics as a discipline is about understanding behavior around our worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s limited resources, then Indigenomics should be a field of study on its own under that umbrella. For all economic practitioners. Indigenous lands are estimated to make up aroundï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½20%ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½of the worldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s territory, containing 80% of its remaining biodiversity (IISD). And, my guess is these are very conservative estimates as they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t include unceded lands and territories. 

In 2011, TD Economics estimated that the size of the indigenous economy in Canada would eclipse $32 billion bis crucial in storytelling. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s also fundamental in building a more connected understanding of the world. Making progress in todayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s world requires us dig into and engage with multiple identities and perspectives simultaneously. Unfortunately, as humans we are wired to seek neatly defined boxes and checklists. It gives us a sense of security and comfort. But weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re way past the point (or at least should be) of one-dimensional invitations or assigned seats. Representation canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be just about proportions because identities are complex and the world we live in requires agility and dynamism. So, perhaps that means that the table and the criteria around it needs to be scrapped, reimagined, and rebuilt, rather than just extended.

While itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a broad lens, there is a lot in this work that is transferable. As Hilton says Indigenomics is about ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½our relationship to d was required) when I was a student. I hope it will have follow on work that digs further and more explicitly into the data and policy side of things.

We are uniquely equipped to be stewards, and this special role is what we are continually being entrusted with.

We are blessed to have role models in this regard. Indigenous communities have been stewards of this planet for millennia, and their knowledge - traditional ecological knowledge is essential to halting our path to self-extinction. 

Honoring them means more than acknowledging their wisdom; it means accepting our intergenerational contract of stewardship with the planet and beyond.

Here are 3 ways to be a true ally to Indigenous peoples:

1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Center Their Voices: Follow and amplify Indigenous-led platforms like Indigenous Climate Action and Nia Tero. These organizations are at the forefront of environmental and cultural preservation, sharing stories that the world needs to hear.

2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hep on hashtags like #LandBack and following groups like Honor The Earth who fight tirelessly for the respect of Indigenous land and self-determination.

3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Invest in Their Movements: Donate or partner with organizations like Seeding Sovereignty and IllumiNative Org, which provide resources and visibility to Indigenous-led projects across environmental, social, and cultural arenas.

In the presence of Indigenous entrepreneurs, Members of Parliament, government leaders, industry, and non-profit partners, Bobbie Racette, Chair of IPF, ceremoniously welcomed Michelle Okere, CFRE, IPFï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s inaugural Executive Director, with a stunning hand-beaded medallion.

The medallion, featuring the IPF logo and a heron, was intricately crafted by Indigenous artist Amber Asp Chief. The heron, found across Turtle Island, symbolizes good fortune, patience, and wisdomï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½qualities that align with the IPFï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mission to empower Indigenous women, youth, and early-stage entrepreneurs through mentorship, funding, and resources for building thriving businesses. The golden sun in the medallion reflects abundance, hope, and stability, illuminating Inuit peoples reflect the diverse communities IPF is committed to supporting.

In her remarks, Bobbie Racette shared:
&quot;This medallion is more than a giftï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a symbol of belonging, strength, and purpose. I hope Michelle feels the unity and prosperity it embodies as she wears it and represents IPF. It reflects the journey we are on together, to uplift Indigenous communities and create new opportunities for generations to come.&quot;

This powerful ceremonyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½alongside the launch of the Money Smarts Board Gameï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½was a reminder of the impact that can be achieved when entrepreneurs, leaders, and partners come together. With Michelleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s leadership and the unwavering support of those in the room, we look forward to advancing Indigenous prosperity across the country.
Congratulations, Michelle Okere, and thank you to everyone who stands with us in this important work!

Trust me, it&#39;s not scary. The goal is not to take all the land back.

If you&#39;re serious about helping the healing process of Native peoples, then you can find a way to do so. 

In reaching out to Native communities and organizations in your area, you can find ways to assist. Or just set an intention. Land Back is a collaborative effort. Goals may differ slightly depending on the community and organization. Yet, there are generally similar overarching goals.

Check out my piece about the Land Back Movement, which also highlights recent successes made through Land Back:

And today, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sharing a short video of that reading here with you.

It is a prayer.
It is a vision.
It is a legacy.

A legacy for a world I dreamed I was building for her.
A world where I walked through fires so she can walk through open doors.
A world where my ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Giving-Kindness-to-Each-Otherï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ theory isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t just imaginedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½but lived.

This post is a brief inside view of the direction my book is takingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and the heart of my work as a Reconciliation Strategist.

My deepest hope is that when she reads this in 2059, sheï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and all of usï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",TRUE,"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; SM-G981B) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.162 Mobile Safari/537.36",Unknown

#economicreconciliation #indigenousentrepreneurs #decolonizingbusinessï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ | Ja,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janisbrooks_economicreconciliation-indigenousentrepreneurs-activity-7317973457026064387-pHB2,"You canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t say you support economic reconciliation - and delay payment to your Indigenous contractors. Yet this has happened with three of my clients  in Q1 alone.

A lot of organizations say they support economic reconciliation, but their procurement systems tell a different story.

Because economic reconciliation isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t a policy statement. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a practice. And it starts with something as basic and as powerful as paying Indigenous businesses on time.

Of course, all of these clients apologize for late payments.

But when youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re an Indigenous entrepreneur, an apology doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t cover the mortgage. It doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t ease the stress of running a business in systems that were never designed for you.

Whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s worse? Thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s often no interest, no admin fee, no recourse.

Meanwhile, those same systems expect us to:
- Naviga with the values.

And thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s the heart of it:
Economic reconciliation isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t about goodwill. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s about structural change.

It means:

#tribalsovereignty #landback | Kevin Washburn | 22 comments,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kevinwashburn_tribalsovereignty-landback-activity-6999468680271077376-Wg0W,"On December 18, 2014, the Obama-Biden Administration removed &quot;the Alaska exception&quot; to the land-into-trust regulations. This rule cleared the way to create new Indian reservations in Alaska. See https://lnkd.in/ggiTfzxf  

It was one of the proudest moments of my life.

Changing federal Indian policy is not easy. It took more than eight years and dueling solicitor&#39;s opinions for the law to be applied successfully, but the good news is that the Biden-Harris Administration is about to take the first new parcel of land in Alaska into trust. https://lnkd.in/gXvmsMT4 

Thank to ASIA Bryan Newland and Solicitor Bob Anderson for getting the first Alaska trust land acquisition across the finish line.  

Thank you, Heather Miller, for turning the United States around on this issue. 

And congratulations to the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska for doing the hard work to expand tribal sovereignty!

Indigenous businesses are rapidly transforming Canada&#39;s economy, with over 50,000 Indigenous-owned enterprises across various sectors. This growth is not just about economic prosperity but also about self-determination, reconciliation, and strengthening Indigenous leadership.

Initiatives like the Indigenomics movement and Forward Summit are vital in supporting Indigenous entrepreneurs. Indigenomics envisions a $100 billion Indigenous economy built on innovation and investment, benefiting both Indigenous communities and the broader Canadian economy.

Despite challenges such as global trade tensions and political uncertainty, Indigenous businesses continue to show resilience, adapting to changing circumstances. Platforms like Forward Summit provide essential spaces for collaboration and growth, reshaping perceptions of Indigenous business from underrepresented to key economic contributors.

As Indigenous businesses drive innovation, sustainability, and ethical practices, investing in their success is crucial for Canada&#39;s economic future. Learn more about the rise of Indigenous business and its impact:

I wasnýýýt just consuming knowledgeýýýI was collecting it, curating it, and applying it to build something greater: Indigpreneur.

This past year, I completed my PhD at Queen&#39;s University, and my thesis topic was &quot;Indigenous Procurement as a Catalyst for Community Building&quot; (https://lnkd.in/g5uwkivs).

One of the biggest opportunities for Indigenous entrepreneurs right now is procurement. For example, the federal mandate to have a minimum of 5% Indigenous procurement across all federal departments (they are currently doing under 1% Indigenous procurement) provides a significant opportunity for Indigenous entrepreneurs.

However, to take advantage of procurement opportunities, we need to have more scalable Indigenous businesses. How do we get more scalable businesses? Through access to resources, funding, and opportunities. 

This doesn&#39;t just extend to Indigenous entrepreneursï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½business support organizations, such as regional IFIs will also need to have increased funding, resources, and capacx of scalable Indigenous businesses that require their support.

Let&#39;s support NACCA by sharing their message. I personally would like to see more Indigenous businesses taking advantage of the procurement opportunities. This doesn&#39;t just benefit Indigenous businesses and communities; it also contributes to Canada&#39;s economy.

1. Connect With Indigenous Economic Leaders
From Indigenous Nations to financial institutions, energy developers to clean tech innovators ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ this is where real partnerships begin.
Build relationships that matter. Walk away with contacts, contracts, and collaborative momentum.

2. Learn From the Voices Reshaping Finance
Hear directly from Indigenous CEOs, entrepreneurs, youth leaders, and economic development corporations. Their stories are rewriting the narrative ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ from cost centres to economic powerhouses.
Come to listen, learn, and be changed.

3. Witness Economic Reconciliation in Action
Indigenomics on Bay Street is not a conference ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a platform of visibility. A space to shift outdated systems and create a new design of inclusion, innovation, and Indigenous economic strength.
Be part of the shift. Be part of the solution.
