We believe in equipping individuals with the skills, tools, and innovative tokenomics frameworks needed to lead and shape the technologies of the future, ensuring Indigenous voices are at the forefront of innovation.

Tokenomics represents an opportunity to align traditional Indigenous values, such as reciprocity, sustainability, and community governance, with technology. By leveraging blockchain and decentralized systems, Indigenous communities can create equitable economic models that prioritize long-term prosperity, self-determination, and resource stewardship.

Through our AI, blockchain, and tokenomics training, we‚Äôre addressing historical gaps by providing meaningful pathways for growth, agency, and creativity. This initiative goes beyond education, it‚Äôs about cultivating leaders who can bridge the gap between tradition and technology, driving progress while uplifting Indigenous values and principles.

Together, we are shaping and cultivating a future where Indigenous communities lead with confidence, vision, and impact. 

Special Opportunity for Indigenous Participants:

üåè With diversity &amp; inclusion policies being wound back in the U.S., ripple effects are reaching Australia. As we approach a potential change in Government, what would this mean for supplier diversity and the Indigenous business sector?

üìâ If Indigenous procurement initiatives are scaled back, will Government agencies &amp; corporations reduce their engagement with Indigenous businesses? And if so, is this good or bad?

üìà Over the past five years, Indigenous businesses have grown at an unprecedented rate‚Äî some genuinely Indigenous owned and others not so much. Likewise, more organisations are publicly committing to Indigenous procurement‚Äîranging from those with genuine engagement to others merely fulfilling a checkbox requirement‚úÖ 

üîÑ A Reset is Overdue‚Äîregardless of who is in charge or what policies are in place.

‚öñÔ∏è If supplier diversity loses traction, companies may no longer feel obligated to meet arbitrary spending targets. This could shift the focus from quantity to quality‚Äîwhere Indigenous businesses are valued for their capabilities, innovation &amp; problem-solving skills, not just their ownership status.

‚úÖ Being Indigenous-owned is a powerful differentiator, but it should not be the only one. Long-term success comes from delivering real value, building credibility, &amp; solving genuine business challenges.

ü§ù I don‚Äôt want to see supplier diversity disappear‚ÄîI‚Äôve built meaningful business relationships through existing frameworks. But I do believe the Indigenous business sector is ready for a shakeup‚Äîone that ensures credibility, impact &amp; long-term sustainability.

What do you think needs to happen?

Indigenous people involvement in business on the rise says author - APTN‚Ä¶ | Saskatchewan Indigenous Economic Development Network (SIEDN),https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saskatchewan-indigenous-economic-development-network-siedn_indigenous-people-involvement-in-business-activity-7267555167326089217-3vhr,"üìà A Tidal Wave of Indigenous Entrepreneurship: Insights from Carol Anne Hilton üåä

Carol Anne Hilton, founder of the Indigenomics Institute, sees a &quot;tidal wave&quot; of Indigenous business growth driven by increased access to capital and improved internet in rural areas. Indigenous women, in particular, are leading the way, starting businesses at five times the national rate and securing roles on corporate boards. Hilton, an award-winning leader from the Nuu chah nulth Nation, sees this growth as a step toward economic reconciliation.

According to Hilton, the rise in Indigenous entrepreneurship is also due to a changing mindset in Canada‚Äôs banking sector. As Indigenous leaders now hold positions on the boards of major financial institutions, new doors are opening for Indigenous business ventures.

Hilton‚Äôs book, Indigenomics: Taking a Seat at the Economic Table, aims to ignite a $100 billion Indigenous economy. This November, the Indigenomics Institute will host a 24-hour Indigenous global economic forum, spotlighting 36 speakers to discuss the future of Indigenous business.

üåç &quot;We‚Äôre building an ecosystem of successful Indigenous business leaders, providing stories and support to inspire others.&quot; ‚Äì Carol Anne Hilton

This past year, I completed my PhD at Queen&#39;s University, and my thesis topic was &quot;Indigenous Procurement as a Catalyst for Community Building&quot; (https://lnkd.in/g5uwkivs).

One of the biggest opportunities for Indigenous entrepreneurs right now is procurement. For example, the federal mandate to have a minimum of 5% Indigenous procurement across all federal departments (they are currently doing under 1% Indigenous procurement) provides a significant opportunity for Indigenous entrepreneurs.

However, to take advantage of procurement opportunities, we need to have more scalable Indigenous businesses. How do we get more scalable businesses? Through access to resources, funding, and opportunities. 

This doesn&#39;t just extend to Indigenous entrepreneurs‚Äîbusiness support organizations, such as regional IFIs will also need to have increased funding, resources, and capacity to support the influx of scalable Indigenous businesses that require their support.

Let&#39;s support NACCA by sharing their message. I personally would like to see more Indigenous businesses taking advantage of the procurement opportunities. This doesn&#39;t just benefit Indigenous businesses and communities; it also contributes to Canada&#39;s economy.

#indigenomics #reconciliation #telus | Jen Newsted,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jennewsted_indigenomics-reconciliation-telus-activity-7136399479271813121-KTCm,"This year I was gifted ample connection to many fantastic humans who walked alongside the Indigenomics Institute to advance #Indigenomics

A trio of fantastic humans that I want to shine my gratitude on are Tashia Kootenayoo, Stephanie Han and Jen Howton from TELUS. It has been a delight to work with these three, to engage in truthful and curious conversations, and have their support in advancing economic reconciliation. Much gratitude to each of you for how you show up!

Last night I read TELUS&#39; recently released 2023 Indigenous Reconciliation and Connectivity Report and I would encourage folks to do the same.  https://lnkd.in/g3Yuk7xm

I encourage folks to read it for three reasons. The first reason is we, non-Indigenous folks, are grossly overdue on our collective duty to be responding to truth and reconciliation. The second reason is because I have experience both working in telecommunications and leading the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business Progressive Aboriginal Relations program and I know just how much persistent, intentional effort is required to prioritize reconciliation and shift behaviours inside both giant and small working environments as the barriers to allow change to transpire can and do run deep within each of us as individuals, as a collective and in the colonial system we exist within. 

The third reason is when I read this report I can see that TELUS is both acknowledging they have learning to do AND that they are implementing their learnings from the Indigenous voices they are learning from. This is what reconciliation looks like my friends. 

It looks like Johnny Kelto III being the first voice we hear from followed by acknowledgments of the obligation and responsibility that we non-Indigenous folks/businesses have to ensure there is no longer misappropriation of Indigenous art/artists. 

It looks like bringing our responsibility to be responding to TRC Call to Action 92 to life through prioritized actions that are progressing, not just words in polished corporate copy on websites. 

Give the Indigenous Reconciliation and Connectivity Report a read and invite curiosity in to ask where reconciliation is at with your company/business/self and what will your company/business/self start shifting to ensure you are progressing in persistent, intentional reconcili-ACTION?

No matter how big or small our places of work are reconciliation is required, and it is not difficult. The difficulty, is a barrier that stems from the discomfort of being responsible to acknowledge difficult truths. We must have truth centered in order for reconciliation to happen. So let&#39;s get truthful.

#reconciliation #indigenoushistorymonth #indigenomics | Jen Newsted,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jennewsted_reconciliation-indigenoushistorymonth-activity-7073009269847035904-TisW,"I had a conversation with a white woman earlier this year about reconciliation and they had shared that if they can&#39;t get it right their organization wasn&#39;t going to go anywhere near it.

This perspective is one that many individuals and businesses have across the country, this isn&#39;t new news.

It is a problematic perspective because it continues to uphold racism and systems of oppression. 

We are each, individually, and collectively, responsible to be righting relations and actively responding to Truth and Reconciliation Call to Action 92. 

It is phenomenally straightforward what we are meant to do, as example:
Listen to Indigenous voices.
Learn from Indigenous voices.
Invest in Indigenous voices.
Support Indigenous voices.
Be led by Indigenous voices.
Believe Indigenous voices.

When I think about folks who say they don&#39;t want to get it wrong so they aren&#39;t going to do anything, I wonder why they are so comfortable to share their very obvious tells that they haven&#39;t taken any of the above straightforward steps, that they aren&#39;t interested in taking a look within, and they have no concern about the harms they continue to uphold.

If you just don&#39;t know where to start, here is a suggestion, get in the room where Indigenous folks are leading and sharing. 

There is an incredible opportunity in Toronto this November and every sector I have been part of advertising, healthcare, tech, non-profit, tv and film, telecommunications absolutely have no reason to not be in this room. 

Let&#39;s get in this room and start shifting our individual and collective accountability into impactful actions that right relations and ensure prosperity for those whose lands we keep saying we live, work and play on.

Let&#39;s show up beyond our continued copy and paste acknowledgements of being on stolen land and step into dismantling the barriers we know exist and that we are benefitting from.

The great Naci√≥n Siekopai of #Ecuador, an Indigenous people who have waged a centuries-long battle against conquest, against forced displacement, against forgetting - have finally recovered ownership of their ancestral homeland in the heart of the #amazonia 

The court‚Äôs verdict is in! 104,000 acres will be returned to the #Siekopai people. Their legal victory - which recognizes their collective right to land tenure over their ancestral land - sets a huge precedent for Indigenous nations across Ecuador, and the broader Amazon, to secure permanent legal title over their forests!

After centuries of resistance against conquest, violence and racism, today is a day for rejoicing: Indigenous territories need to be in Indigenous hands!

#economicreconciliation #indigenousentrepreneurs #decolonizingbusiness‚Ä¶ | Janis Brooks | 16 comments,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janisbrooks_economicreconciliation-indigenousentrepreneurs-activity-7317973457026064387-pHB2,"You can‚Äôt say you support economic reconciliation - and delay payment to your Indigenous contractors. Yet this has happened with three of my clients  in Q1 alone.

A lot of organizations say they support economic reconciliation, but their procurement systems tell a different story.

Because economic reconciliation isn‚Äôt a policy statement. It‚Äôs a practice. And it starts with something as basic and as powerful as paying Indigenous businesses on time.

Of course, all of these clients apologize for late payments.

But when you‚Äôre an Indigenous entrepreneur, an apology doesn‚Äôt cover the mortgage. It doesn‚Äôt ease the stress of running a business in systems that were never designed for you.

What‚Äôs worse? There‚Äôs often no interest, no admin fee, no recourse.

Meanwhile, those same systems expect us to:
- Navigate outdated processes
- Accept inflexible terms
- Be professional and patient, no matter the cost

It‚Äôs not that these organizations don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs that the systems haven‚Äôt caught up with the values.

And that‚Äôs the heart of it:
Economic reconciliation isn‚Äôt about goodwill. It‚Äôs about structural change.

It means:
- Redesigning procurement to reflect Indigenous values
- Embedding flexibility, reciprocity, and shared accountability
- Understanding that equity isn‚Äôt just about access, it‚Äôs about how systems treat us once we‚Äôre in

If your systems weren‚Äôt built with Indigenous businesses in mind? You can‚Äôt just hope for better results. You have to build better systems.

This is what I help clients do. If you&#39;re committed to moving beyond performative action - Let‚Äôs talk about what true economic reconciliation could look like in your procurement practices.

From 2005 to 2018, Indigenous-owned businesses grew by 37%. But despite this growth, major gaps persist:

a) 7.5% less productive
b) 2.7% lower revenue
c) 18.4% more likely to exit the market

These challenges are even greater in rural areas, where many Indigenous businesses operate.Structural barriers‚Äîlimited capital, poor infrastructure, and geographic isolation‚Äîcontinue to hold back Indigenous entrepreneurs.

Resilience isn‚Äôt the issue. Access is.

If we‚Äôre serious about reconciliation, we need targeted investment, bold procurement strategies, and Indigenous-led solutions. That includes our own communities stepping up to buy from Indigenous businesses.

Indigenous business owners bring innovation, resilience, and expertise to every industry. Yet, they often face unconscious biases that limit opportunities and partnerships. Here are some common ones:

‚ùå Assuming Indigenous businesses are less experienced or professional
‚ùå Believing they rely on government handouts instead of being self-sustaining
‚ùå Expecting discounts or free labor in the name of ‚Äúcommunity support‚Äù
‚ùå Only valuing Indigenous businesses for cultural work, not modern industries
‚ùå Questioning Indigenous leadership styles and decision-making
‚ùå Doubting their ability to run long-term, successful businesses

This is something I‚Äôve been reflecting on deeply. Lately, I‚Äôve been presenting a lot on unconscious bias and truth and reconciliation. Through these conversations, I‚Äôve gained a new understanding of what meaningful partnerships with Indigenous businesses look like.

Luckily, we‚Äôve had some amazing clients at Indigenius Projects and Events who have shown me what true reconciliation champions look like. They:

‚úÖ Allow Indigenous companies to lead
‚úÖ Support when there are potential gaps in skill sets
‚úÖ Collaborate in decision-making rather than dictating
‚úÖ Respect Indigenous knowledge systems and ways of doing business
‚úÖ Honor agreements and ensure fair compensation, just like with any other business
‚úÖ Invest in long-term relationships rather than one-time partnerships
‚úÖ Advocate for Indigenous businesses in rooms where we are not present
‚úÖ Recognize that reconciliation is an ongoing process, not a checkbox

This new knowledge, along with the wisdom shared by fellow Indigenous truth and reconciliation speakers, has shifted my perspective and expanded my understanding of what it truly means to partner with an Indigenous company.

Reconciliation isn‚Äôt just about land acknowledgments or one-time contracts‚Äîit‚Äôs about ongoing, respectful, and equitable relationships. Are you ready to be a reconciliation champion?

Some of the key points included:

- The co-management of mining within the NWT between Indigenous groups, government and industry. 

- The best practices of socio-economic agreements and Impact Benefit Agreements that have resulted in meaningful employment, capacity building, economic opportunity and infrastructure. 

- The planned reclamation of the mines before they are even started ensuring that there isn‚Äôt a negative legacy at the end of mine life. 

- How the mining sector has impacted Indigenous communities both positively and negatively. 

- The eye watering experiences of Lily James and her team experiencing -50 for the first time (full disclosure it‚Äôs still darn cold for us northerners as well.

The reason I ask is because I get lots of asks from folks looking for connections or introductions to Indigenous folks that I might know. 

Here&#39;s the secret to you skipping the step of having to ask me who I know: Activate your reconciliation commitments by intentionally prioritizing getting yourself into spaces that are Indigenous led so that YOU are in fact doing the work to meet, connect, cultivate relationships with Indigenous leaders and businesses. 

The learning that comes from being in Indigenous led spaces, like the annual events the Indigenomics Institute hosts, are phenomenally rich and imperative for our reconciliation responsibility. But you know this because I have been telling you which is why you are reaching out to me. Remember this is our shared responsibility.

Indigenomics SHE has 40 Indigenous leaders who will share their insights, experiences, challenges, successes in government, law, finance, tech, education, communications, fashion, art, tourism, culinary, corporate canada, entrepreneurism.

The conference will be hosted and emceed again this year by three epic humans who are shining brightly in the image from last year&#39;s SHE conference. Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D, CEO and founder of Indigenomics Institute, Global Centre of Indigenomics &amp; the Global Indigenous Technology House, Ashley Richard Director, Indigenous Entrepreneurship University of Waterloo and Diane Roussin BA, BSW, M.S.M. ü¶¶ Project Director, The Winnipeg Boldness Project.

Keynotes are from Laurie Sterritt Managing Partner Pathways Executive Search and Victoria LaBillois, MBA owner of Wejipeg Excavation and founder Eloquent Hostess. 

Additionally, in the room are representatives from Women Entrepreneurship Knowledge Hub (WEKH), TELUS, Vancity, Alliance Trust Company, Calgary, Canada, BFL CANADA, RBC and Scotiabank who are all actively contributing to #Indigenomics as partners and sponsors.

Reconciliation is about relationships and relationships do not happen in documents collecting dust. Please get in this room AND bring your c-suite, your board members, your teams, your clients because my goodness the opportunities that we have to actually show up in reconciliation are abundant - shift status quo behaviour so you stop being the barrier of why you/your company&#39;s reconciliation isn&#39;t progressing. 

If you can&#39;t physically be there you can still contribute by committing to an Accessibility package that will allow for Indigenous folks to participate on your behalf. This is also how we start to cultivate relationships. 

Finally, here&#39;s another super simple way to action reconciliation: Copy the link below and put it in your newsletters. It isn&#39;t difficult friends, unless we make it. 

I hope I see you in Winnipeg for #Indigenomics

Within the framework of Indigenomics, &quot;tsawalk&quot; becomes a guiding light, to acknowledge the intrinsic interconnectedness of our economic systems with the natural world. Indigenomics NOW is designed to reflect the natural world and serves to advance an economic narrative that is shaped by the natural world.

Indigenomics NOW serves as a powerful platform to translate this philosophy into action. November 14th ,2024. Registration opens soon.

We are uniquely equipped to be stewards, and this special role is what we are continually being entrusted with.

We are blessed to have role models in this regard. Indigenous communities have been stewards of this planet for millennia, and their knowledge - traditional ecological knowledge is essential to halting our path to self-extinction. 

Honoring them means more than acknowledging their wisdom; it means accepting our intergenerational contract of stewardship with the planet and beyond.

Here are 3 ways to be a true ally to Indigenous peoples:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Center Their Voices: Follow and amplify Indigenous-led platforms like Indigenous Climate Action and Nia Tero. These organizations are at the forefront of environmental and cultural preservation, sharing stories that the world needs to hear.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Support Indigenous Sovereignty: Advocate for land rights and protections with groups by reading up on hashtags like #LandBack and following groups like Honor The Earth who fight tirelessly for the respect of Indigenous land and self-determination.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Invest in Their Movements: Donate or partner with organizations like Seeding Sovereignty and IllumiNative Org, which provide resources and visibility to Indigenous-led projects across environmental, social, and cultural arenas.

This isn‚Äôt just a day for reflection‚Äîit‚Äôs a call to action! For the Earth, for honoring our original oath, and for all future generations.

#blockchain #selfdetermination #indigenomics | Nationsfirst,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nationsfirst_blockchain-selfdetermination-indigenomics-activity-7208582632442314753-KPG3,"The Indian Act, established in 1876 by the Canadian government, was not designed to honor or leverage the economic wealth of Indigenous peoples. Instead, it was primarily set up as a tool for assimilation and control, imposing European governance structures, restricting Indigenous rights, and undermining traditional economic and social systems. This Act centralized decision-making by Canada, disempowering Indigenous communities and disconnecting them from their traditional governance and economic practices, which were deeply intertwined with their cultural and spiritual beliefs. 

To truly move towards self-determination, Indigenous communities may need to unlearn the systems imposed by the Indian Act and re-engage with their traditional ways. This involves revitalizing Indigenous legal systems and cultural practices and may include adopting modern technologies such as blockchain. Utilizing blockchain could provide transparent and secure methods for managing community resources and transactions, potentially even supporting the creation of a value-based currency that reflects Indigenous values and priorities. Such steps are fundamental in re-establishing Indigenous economic systems and governance structures on their terms and according to their traditional laws and practices.

It took more than eight years and dueling solicitor&#39;s opinions for the law to be applied successfully, but the good news is that the Biden-Harris Administration is about to take the first new parcel of land in Alaska into trust. https://lnkd.in/gXvmsMT4 

Thank to ASIA Bryan Newland and Solicitor Bob Anderson for getting the first Alaska trust land acquisition across the finish line.  

Thank you, Heather Miller, for turning the United States around on this issue. 

And congratulations to the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska for doing the hard work to expand tribal sovereignty!

Journalist Kalen Goodluck (Din√©, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Tsimshian), author of the article, ‚ÄúHow the Land Back Movement Is Unraveling Manifest Destiny‚Äù, goes into great detail about recent wins, the long and painful history of Native land theft, the hurdles preventing our communities from acquiring land, the cultural significance of reclaiming stolen land, and the spirit of the phrase itself.

A Truth and Reconciliation Day was announced, and tomorrow we commemorate the second annual recognition of the ongoing need for reconciliation in this country.
¬†
When it comes to #reconciliation, making long-term progress demands that our actions be grounded in accountability and transparency. Deloitte&#39;s Reconciliation Action Plan year-two update report: Our progress on the shared path for reconciliation, shares some of the ongoing efforts we have made to fund Indigenous groups and their allies, adapt our systems, and provide resources for our employees to educate themselves about Indigenous culture. The road to reconciliation is long and, at times, challenging, but we continue to strive toward being better listeners and doing our part in contributing to reconciliation efforts. 
¬†
In honour of this important day, we have given our people tomorrow off in the hopes they will use this time to reflect and continue to educate themselves ‚Äì be it attending a workshop, reading a book from an Indigenous author, donating to a local Indigenous-run charity, or learning more about the rich culture and history of Indigenous peoples. On this day, and throughout the year, our primary focus must be to listen, learn, and do our part.¬†We hope our actions will serve as inspiration for others to do the same.

I needed to learn from the business women and men who had done this before me!  I learned very quickly that we were not in competition, and so many successful business people were willing to help me grow my business!

I learned from several business books published by successful business women and I shamelessly support the writings and teachings from  Arlene Dickinson, Venture Communications.  I had chats with the successful beauty brand #Cheekbone creator, Jen Harper, and successful female leaders from #indigenomics, Carol Anne Hilton; #yukonsoaps, #RavenReads,#Indigenousbox, #BearsLairTV creator Geena Jackson and so many more peer mentors and successful business people across Canada.

I also have a business coach who helps me  to  find resources for the growth  and management of my business.

Had the opportunity to connect with lots of colleagues while proudly representing Tlicho Investment Corporation &amp; Group of Companies with members of the team and Tlicho leadership. 

Several of us sat down on a panel discussing a decarbonized mining world. Some great examples from across the North for both active and exploration mining project all of which had significant Indigenous involvement. 

It was announced that I have joined the board for Kingfisher Metals Corp.  Excited to join Dustin Perry, P.Geo. and the team in their journey to develop the next world class properties in the golden triangle.  They have a great vision and are focused on creating value for the Tahltan nation on the lands that they operate on. 

Hope everyone had an excellent PDAC as well!!!

#indigenousentrepreneur #indigenomics #indigenousbusiness‚Ä¶ | Trent Billette ü™∂,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/trent-billette-%F0%9F%AA%B6-aa3982261_indigenousentrepreneur-indigenomics-indigenousbusiness-activity-7303229047981977600-vKo2,"üìö My Journey as an Indigenous Entrepreneur: From Reading to Building a Knowledge Library üìö

When I first set out on this journey, I had a simple goal: read one book a month to sharpen my skills as an entrepreneur. But somewhere along the way, I realized this was bigger than just reading. I wasn‚Äôt just consuming knowledge‚ÄîI was collecting it, curating it, and applying it to build something greater: Indigpreneur.

As Indigenous people, our knowledge has always been passed down through stories, teachings, and lived experience. Today, books have become another way for me to learn from those who came before us‚Äîleaders, thinkers, and changemakers who have built businesses, disrupted industries, and reshaped economies.

üìñ Starting with ‚ÄúIndigenomics: Taking a Seat at the Economic Table‚Äù by Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D 

This book isn‚Äôt just a read‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint. Hilton lays out how Indigenous people can reclaim economic power, create wealth in our communities, and move beyond surviving to thriving in business. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder that we don‚Äôt need to fit into existing systems‚Äîwe can build our own.

üöÄ How Indigpreneur Will Implement These Teachings:

‚úÖ Building Indigenous-Led Networks: Indigenomics highlights the need for strong Indigenous business ecosystems. Through Indigpreneur, I‚Äôm focused on creating a network where Indigenous entrepreneurs collaborate, share resources, and grow together.

‚úÖ Creating Wealth, Not Just Jobs: Hilton talks about the importance of ownership. Indigpreneur isn‚Äôt just about helping Indigenous businesses start‚Äîit‚Äôs about helping them scale, sustain, and create long-term wealth in our communities.

‚úÖ Elevating Indigenous Innovation: Indigenous knowledge and ways of doing business are an advantage, not a limitation. I want Indigpreneur to champion modern Indigenous business models‚Äîones rooted in our values, but thriving in today‚Äôs economy.

üì¢ This isn‚Äôt just about me‚Äîit‚Äôs about all of us. If you‚Äôre an Indigenous entrepreneur, business leader, or changemaker, let‚Äôs connect and share knowledge.

üèÜ Join the Indigenous Entrepreneur Roundtable

At the end of this month, I‚Äôm hosting a roundtable discussion where we‚Äôll explore how we can take action on these ideas, share insights, and connect as Indigenous entrepreneurs.

Five years ago today, I stepped into this role in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic  - a time of immense uncertainty for all of us. The early days of the pandemic proved just how important our work is - ensuring Indigenous businesses have the support, resources, and opportunities they need to thrive. Despite the challenges, I was fortunate to have a dedicated team committed to supporting Indigenous entrepreneurs and communities. Together, we adapted, redefined how we worked, and most importantly ensured that family and mental health remained a top priority. 

Since then, we have seen incredible growth, with CCIB&#39;s membership expanding from 1,000 to 2,700 strong. Introducing new programs, advocating for change and constantly improving our supports. This reflects not only the strength and resilience of Indigenous businesses but also the increasing recognition of the importance of Indigenous procurement and economic empowerment.

Today, we find ourselves in another period of uncertainty, and just as we were then, CCIB will be here stronger than ever - advocating, supporting, and ensuring Indigenous businesses continue to grow and succeed.

On a personal level, these past five years have been filled with both joy and challenges. I&#39;ve watched my sons grow into young men and navigated family loss and illness, all while spending more time traveling to attend important events. ¬†I am grateful for every experience, but for those who think it is all glamourous it has often meant I have missed moments at home. Through it all, I have been deeply grateful for the support of my husband and kids, who have stood by me every step of the way.

I feel very blessed for all of the opportunities of growth that this journey has provided and honoured by the recognition this role has brought. Most importantly, I am so thankful for everyone who has been part of this journey our team, ¬†members, partners, and friends. Your commitment and belief in our work continue to inspire me every day. 

Chi miigwetch for walking this path with me. Here&#39;s to the next chapter!

Here‚Äôs the latest from my Indigenous Entrepreneurial Journey:
‚úÖ 34 meetings this week ‚Äî a personal record!
- 6 consultants ‚Äî all thoughtful and productive conversations
- 2 modular housing companies ‚Äî interesting, but not quite the right fit for me
- 11 ‚Äútire kickers‚Äù ‚Äî folks mostly looking to sell something
- 15 fantastic new friends and allies ‚Äî people I genuinely look forward to working with again

I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for the chance to connect with so many people this week. Every conversation adds to the bigger picture, and I‚Äôm especially encouraged by the number of non-Indigenous allies I met who are doing this work with respect, honesty, and real heart.

It‚Äôs helped restore some of the hope I‚Äôve lost over the years when it comes to meaningful reconciliation (not all of it ‚Äî policing will do that to you). But these connections matter, and they move us forward.

Wishing you all a restful weekend. I&#39;m already looking forward to what next week brings.

We discussed how many entrepreneurs struggle to see the true value they create for others. Many view their products or services as singular, not realizing that what they truly offer is multidimensional and, in many ways, invaluable. I used to think this way too. As an event manager specializing in Indigenous experiences, I once felt that all I was doing was planning events. It wasn‚Äôt until later that I saw the deeper value I was creating‚Äînot just for my corporate clients but also for Indigenous entertainers, vendors, entrepreneurs, Elders, and every participant we serve at our events.

I was impacting the next generation of Indigenous youth attending conferences and contributing to the Indigenous economy. I was providing opportunities that some might say are priceless, with no cost that could truly capture the value my company was creating. Imagine how I felt when I realized this. The value my company was generating‚Äîand the value I brought with my skills, life experience, and knowledge‚Äîhelped me understand the broader economic impact of my services.

I was no longer ‚Äòjust an event planner.‚Äô This unique awareness is something I teach my Diamonds Mastermind students as well. I guide them to see that they are not simply selling a product or service‚Äîthey are offering so much more. I help them uncover the value in their business and within themselves. Only when we recognize and charge our true worth can we fully serve those we aim to support. This alignment, this balance‚Äîthe yin and yang‚Äîcreates and sustains the flow of life.

As an Indigenous entrepreneur, I&#39;ve witnessed firsthand the transformative power of combining our ancestral knowledge with contemporary business practices. Our communities have always been innovators, traders, and stewards of sustainable enterprise.

‚ú® Preserving Cultural Legacy
‚Ä¢ Creating enterprises that honor our traditions
‚Ä¢ Sharing our stories through ethical commerce
‚Ä¢ Building sustainable models that respect Mother Earth

‚Ä¢ Reinvesting in Indigenous communities
‚Ä¢ Fostering economic sovereignty

üåü Innovative Solutions
‚Ä¢ Blending traditional wisdom with modern technology
‚Ä¢ Creating unique products and services
‚Ä¢ Leading in sustainable business practices

To my fellow Indigenous entrepreneurs: Your voice matters. Your innovations matter. Your businesses matter. We&#39;re not just building companies‚Äîwe&#39;re creating legacies that honor our ancestors while paving the way for our children.

To allies and partners: Let&#39;s collaborate to create an inclusive economy that celebrates Indigenous innovation and entrepreneurship. Together, we can build a future where Indigenous business leadership thrives.

üîãIndigenous People‚Äôs are leading the clean energy transition. 
‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ÄùIndigenous inclusion means a just transition to a clean energy future.‚Äù ~ Carol Anne Hilton, MBA 
‚ñ´Ô∏è Research from a 2020 Indigenous Clean Energy Social Enterprise report identified 197  Canadian companies in the clean energy sector.
‚ñ´Ô∏è Research from Chris Henderson was cited, noting ‚ÄúIndigenous communities are the third largest owners of clean energy companies in Canada.‚Äù

üß≠ The theory of change must chart the straightest line between the current and future state. This must involve meaningful and deep consideration of what economic reconciliation means and a commitment and plan to advance it. Without this understanding, there is a risk of advancing projects merely for marketing purposes, missing true impact.

Indigenous businesses are rapidly transforming Canada&#39;s economy, with over 50,000 Indigenous-owned enterprises across various sectors. This growth is not just about economic prosperity but also about self-determination, reconciliation, and strengthening Indigenous leadership.

Initiatives like the Indigenomics movement and Forward Summit are vital in supporting Indigenous entrepreneurs. Indigenomics envisions a $100 billion Indigenous economy built on innovation and investment, benefiting both Indigenous communities and the broader Canadian economy.

Despite challenges such as global trade tensions and political uncertainty, Indigenous businesses continue to show resilience, adapting to changing circumstances. Platforms like Forward Summit provide essential spaces for collaboration and growth, reshaping perceptions of Indigenous business from underrepresented to key economic contributors.

As Indigenous businesses drive innovation, sustainability, and ethical practices, investing in their success is crucial for Canada&#39;s economic future. Learn more about the rise of Indigenous business and its impact:

The results of COP29 Azerbaijan have definitely compounded this idea. It‚Äôs challenging lately to walk away from these global conveneings with clear key takeaways. 

At these events, many people ask questions like ‚ÄúWhat does is it mean to truly stand in solidarity with the communities most impacted by climate change and biodiversity loss?‚Äù To get some much-needed insight, I interviewed three Indigenous leaders from the Amazon who were invited to speak at #COP16, but not included in any of the negotiations among the organizers and governments to finance solutions‚Äîdespite the fact that Indigenous peoples steward 80% of the world‚Äôs biodiversity.

When I started Sacred Workplaces, I wore every hat: Founder, marketer, salesperson, and bookkeeper. But as we‚Äôve grown, so have the administrative demands‚Äîand trying to do it all is burning me out (and honestly, my bookkeeping was‚Ä¶ not my sacred work üòÖ).  

So today, I‚Äôm dismantling the shame around asking for help. I‚Äôm thrilled to announce we‚Äôve partnered with CloudCPA LLP to handle our bookkeeping! AND how cool is it that Rachel Brinac, CPB (who‚Äôs helping me) just won this cool award. Making me feel even more cared for as an entrepreneur.

This isn‚Äôt a failure‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic upgrade. By letting go of tasks that aren‚Äôt in my zone of genius, I free up energy to focus on what truly moves the needle: serving our clients and growing our impact.  

Because scaling isn‚Äôt about doing more‚Äîit‚Äôs about leading better. And sometimes, that starts with admitting, This isn‚Äôt my strength‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs okay.

#indigenousentrepreneur #housingsolutions #inspectorinabox #communityfirst‚Ä¶ | Stan Knight | 13 comments,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stan-knight_indigenousentrepreneur-housingsolutions-activity-7314755303030300674-0BUl,"Being an Indigenous entrepreneur comes with incredible purpose ‚Äî but also some tough realities.

Lately, I‚Äôve been reflecting on the challenge of trying to connect with Indigenous leadership and housing decision-makers.

It‚Äôs a delicate balance:

- Cold calling feels intrusive
- Repeated emails feel like noise
- Unannounced or unscheduled visits can feel pushy or even disrespectful ‚Äî and that‚Äôs something I never want to risk, especially knowing how busy and stretched leadership already is
- And pushing too hard can feel like I‚Äôm disrespecting the very values I was raised with ‚Äî because in our culture, persistence without relationship can come off as pressure, not partnership

But I believe deeply in what I‚Äôm offering ‚Äî especially my Inspector in a Box program and broader consultancy services. These aren‚Äôt just products ‚Äî they‚Äôre community-led solutions designed to support Nations in building housing capacity, accessing funding, and creating self-sufficiency.

So how do we get in front of the right people without losing our cultural integrity?

This post isn‚Äôt just a reflection ‚Äî it‚Äôs a genuine ask to my network:
- Indigenous entrepreneurs ‚Äî how do YOU break through respectfully?
- How do you connect with leadership in a way that builds trust, honours their time, and still gets your work seen?

I‚Äôd love to hear what‚Äôs worked for you. Let‚Äôs support each other in building business in a good way.

Over the past 15 years, I suspect that over $1,000,000 of Indigenous-specific post-secondary scholarships and bursaries have been accessed by pretendians. This misuse highlights a significant flaw in the current self-identification process for some scholarships, which often requires no documentation to prove Indigenous identity.

Many post-secondary institutions and private sector businesses allow applicants to self-identify as Indigenous without requiring any proof. In contrast, Indigenous organizations such as the National Indian Brotherhood Trust, Chief Joe Mathias, and Lilwat Nation mandate documentation like a status card or a community letter.

Having been in post-secondary education since 2010, I‚Äôve observed that only about 20% of recipients of Indigenous scholarships or bursaries seemed authentically Indigenous, explicitly sharing their community, language, and culture. The remaining 80%, often vaguely identifying as M√©tis without specifying their community, appeared to exploit the self-identification process, thereby diverting much-needed financial support from genuinely Indigenous students.

The case of the Gill twins is a notable example of this exploitation going unpunished, and I believe there are many more cases out there. It‚Äôs clear that the self-identification process is flawed and primarily benefits pretendians.

We must eliminate self-identification for Indigenous scholarships to ensure that resources dedicated to Indigenous Peoples are used to close the socioeconomic gap for those who truly need and deserve it.

It has been an incredible journey with some amazing progress made in a very short period of time. 

Key accomplishments that stand out for me:

- Bringing an amazing Sr. Leadership team together. The best I have ever had the honour of working with.

- Building out the drivers license, mentorship and Heavy Equipment Operators (HEO) programs to help our members and employees into cool jobs and advancing in their perspective careers.

- Revamping the safety program with a significant shift in safety culture and the roadmap to achieving COR certification. 

- Significant advancement for finance and accounting through outsourced payroll with an online tool to enhance employee value, shift in fiscal year end to improve reporting for the shareholder and a plan to go from a review to an audit.  

- Shift in construction delivery from time and materials into fixed bids. Becoming the general contractor for the TIA at Red Chris mine site and a refreshed fleet with a progressive maintenance program. 

- A focus on employee experience through the first employee survey (we did 2 to date), enhanced compensation and benefits, employee recognition program and exit interviews. 

- Enhanced communication plan with a brand refresh, 2 comprehensive reports per year, rich social media program and regular community engagement. 

I want to thank all of the dedicated TNDC employees. An amazing Sr. Leadership team.  A caring board of directors. A supportive community. Excellent industry and business partners that have supported us through our journey to date. 

Much awesomeness has been achieved and the journey is far from over. TNDC is growing and quickly being a national leader. 

Proud to be a small part of it all.

#economics #indigenomics #storytelling #canada #bookclub | Marwa Abdou,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marwabdou_economics-indigenomics-storytelling-activity-7035654207302967296-WArr,"Just before the holidays, Stephen Tapp, PhD gifted our team five books to offer inspiration for 2023. It didn&#39;t take long before I leapt towards Carol Anne Hilton, MBA&#39;s ‚ÄúIndigenomics ‚Äì taking a seat at the table‚Äù and finally got around to reading it this weekend. 

If Economics as a discipline is about understanding behavior around our world‚Äôs limited resources, then Indigenomics should be a field of study on its own under that umbrella. For all economic practitioners. Indigenous lands are estimated to make up around¬†20%¬†of the world‚Äôs territory, containing 80% of its remaining biodiversity (IISD). And, my guess is these are very conservative estimates as they don‚Äôt include unceded lands and territories. 

In 2011, TD Economics estimated that the size of the indigenous economy in Canada would eclipse $32 billion by 2016. That number has since grown 1.5 X ‚Äì expected to reach 100 billion by 2025. And yet, indigenous voices remain excluded (alongside numerous others).

Intersectionality is crucial in storytelling. It‚Äôs also fundamental in building a more connected understanding of the world. Making progress in today‚Äôs world requires us dig into and engage with multiple identities and perspectives simultaneously. Unfortunately, as humans we are wired to seek neatly defined boxes and checklists. It gives us a sense of security and comfort. But we‚Äôre way past the point (or at least should be) of one-dimensional invitations or assigned seats. Representation can‚Äôt be just about proportions because identities are complex and the world we live in requires agility and dynamism. So, perhaps that means that the table and the criteria around it needs to be scrapped, reimagined, and rebuilt, rather than just extended.

While it‚Äôs a broad lens, there is a lot in this work that is transferable. As Hilton says Indigenomics is about ‚Äúour relationship to ourselves, to each other, to the Earth, to our past, and our future‚Äù. 

All in all, this book didn‚Äôt disappoint. One that I wish existed (and was required) when I was a student. I hope it will have follow on work that digs further and more explicitly into the data and policy side of things.

Trust me, it&#39;s not scary. The goal is not to take all the land back.

If you&#39;re serious about helping the healing process of Native peoples, then you can find a way to do so. 

In reaching out to Native communities and organizations in your area, you can find ways to assist. Or just set an intention. Land Back is a collaborative effort. Goals may differ slightly depending on the community and organization. Yet, there are generally similar overarching goals.

Check out my piece about the Land Back Movement, which also highlights recent successes made through Land Back:

In the presence of Indigenous entrepreneurs, Members of Parliament, government leaders, industry, and non-profit partners, Bobbie Racette, Chair of IPF, ceremoniously welcomed Michelle Okere, CFRE, IPF‚Äôs inaugural Executive Director, with a stunning hand-beaded medallion.

The medallion, featuring the IPF logo and a heron, was intricately crafted by Indigenous artist Amber Asp Chief. The heron, found across Turtle Island, symbolizes good fortune, patience, and wisdom‚Äîqualities that align with the IPF‚Äôs mission to empower Indigenous women, youth, and early-stage entrepreneurs through mentorship, funding, and resources for building thriving businesses. The golden sun in the medallion reflects abundance, hope, and stability, illuminating the path forward. Beaded motifs representing First Nations, M√©tis, and Inuit peoples reflect the diverse communities IPF is committed to supporting.

In her remarks, Bobbie Racette shared:
&quot;This medallion is more than a gift‚Äîit‚Äôs a symbol of belonging, strength, and purpose. I hope Michelle feels the unity and prosperity it embodies as she wears it and represents IPF. It reflects the journey we are on together, to uplift Indigenous communities and create new opportunities for generations to come.&quot;

This powerful ceremony‚Äîalongside the launch of the Money Smarts Board Game‚Äîwas a reminder of the impact that can be achieved when entrepreneurs, leaders, and partners come together. With Michelle‚Äôs leadership and the unwavering support of those in the room, we look forward to advancing Indigenous prosperity across the country.
Congratulations, Michelle Okere, and thank you to everyone who stands with us in this important work!

Indigenomics by DESIGN | Indigenomics,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/indigenomics-institute_indigenomics-by-design-activity-7065360550788009984-8O88,"&quot;I love the concept of Indigenomics which talks about the actual metrics, design, and research for understanding Indigenous economic strength and development. 

We need to tell this new success story and outline the needs in responding to this emerging growing economy. 

Indigenomics is an economic platform to connect to the GDP, identify targets, create collective actions that support wealth generation within our communities. $100 billion Indigenous economy - that is the number we need to be paying attention to.&quot; - Clint Davis

Indigenomics invites dialogue, and thought provoking insight into the possibility of the Indigenous relationship both in Canada and beyond. It explores the pathway of the threshold of the Indigenous relationship and modern economies. 

Join us next week for Indigenomics in ACTION to garner the essential tools and knowledge required to be active partners in our collective response to advancing the 100 Billion Indigenous economy. 

Registration closes today! https://lnkd.in/gyy7gwQC

As a Latino and Indigenous entrepreneur, I know what it‚Äôs like to build something from the ground up without a playbook. No generational wealth, no insider connections‚Äîjust a vision, a lot of grit, and a commitment to creating something bigger than myself.

This program isn‚Äôt just about making Nu√±ez, The People&#39;s Agency and DobleImpact stronger. It‚Äôs about ensuring that diverse businesses don‚Äôt just survive but thrive. Because when we succeed, we open doors for others, we shift industries, and we prove‚Äîagain and again‚Äîthat we belong.

To every entrepreneur out there doing the hard work: Keep going. Keep building. Keep betting on yourself. The doors weren‚Äôt made for us, but that‚Äôs never stopped us before.

Let‚Äôs get to work.

Established in 1996, First Nations Bank of Canada (FNBC) is the only Indigenous-owned Schedule 1 bank in the country. Bill Lomax, CEO, emphasizes the bank‚Äôs unique position in the financial sector. &quot;We‚Äôre part of the financial aspect of nation-building,&quot; he explains. The bank doesn‚Äôt just offer generic services; instead, it works closely with Indigenous communities to understand and meet their specific needs. FNBC prides itself on tailoring solutions to the priorities of the nations it serves, which distinguishes it from larger commercial banks. 

Beyond financing, FNBC also plays a crucial role in helping Indigenous communities manage their financial assets. It works closely with First Nations on trust management, supporting communities as they manage settlements and other financial resources in a sustainable way. This is Indigenomics in action.

This Indigenous horror-comedy, written and directed by Tara Moses  tells the story of siblings Ash and Aaron, who have been haunting their former home for two decades. Through humor and compelling storytelling, the play delves into themes of Indigenous land rights and the Land Back movement, prompting audiences to reflect on our relationship with the land and Native communities.  

Company One Theatre consistently brings thought-provoking plays and educational events to our community, fostering important conversations around social change. I highly encourage everyone to explore their upcoming events and become engaged with their impactful work. Experiences like ‚ÄúHaunted‚Äù not only entertain but also challenge us to think deeply about pressing societal issues.

We kept it short and punchy focussing on:

- The TNDC journey which requires a strong team, supportive community and industry /government support. 

- A drive towards a decarbonzed mining jurisdiction which will be the first Tier 1 carbon neutral mining jurisdiction in Canada.

- The need for Government and Industry to continue investing in Indigenous communities and businesses and the areas they reside in. Indigenous communities are often the gatekeepers for projects to move forward. Bring Indigenous communities into the opportunities in a meaningful way as true partners.

However, the time has come for us to reclaim our narrative and strategically craft a future that aligns with the Indigenous economic worldview.

With the resurgence of business, entrepreneurship, and nation-building, there arises a crucial need for a dedicated space to focus on designing and healing our relationship with money.

Late last year I had the opportunity to travel to Australia with the Tlicho Chiefs to tour some of Fortescue‚Äôs operations and to meet with various Indigenous groups that Fortescue works with throughout their operations. It was truly an inspiring trip with a great company that lives and breathes its values. 

Earlier this week while at the AME Roundup show Tlicho Government signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Fortescue to assist in developing the Tlicho lands for future mineral development (https://lnkd.in/gjAD8DTP). Truly a groundbreaking moment as the nation continues to move forward and develop its economic future. I for one could not be more proud to work with this group and help build a robust economy for the region. 

Congratulations Tlicho on an amazing step in your economic journey.

For Native producers, access to timely, accurate water data can mean the difference between resilience and risk. That‚Äôs why the Native Lands Advocacy Project (NLAP) has developed a comprehensive suite of tools to support informed decision-making, sustainable agricultural planning.

Our tools are free, open-access, and specifically designed to meet the unique needs of Native land stewards and producers.

üíß Key resources include:
üõ∞Ô∏è Surface Waters on Native Lands
üåßÔ∏è Precipitation Projections &amp; Winter Trends
üí¶ Agricultural Water Stress Viewer
üåä Groundwater Data Explorer
üî¨ Water Quality Dashboards ‚Äì pH, Hypoxia, Pesticides, Temperature
üåâ Culvert Condition Viewer
üìà Elevation Profile Explorer

These tools are built to empower Indigenous-led planning and advocacy ‚Äî because data sovereignty is land sovereignty.
