First Nations communities must lead the way in Ontario's bioeconomy. Jason Rasevych, president of the Anishnawbe Business Professional Association (Northern Ontario) , powerfully stated at the Scaling Up Bioeconomy Conference | #ScalingUpBio that First Nations need to have ownership and leadership roles in this growing sector.

Why? Because they hold inherent rights to the land and its resources. Their traditional knowledge and practices are vital for sustainable resource management.

üå∫ The bioeconomy depends on biodiversity as its foundation, and biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth.

üå¥ For example, the rainforests of the Amazon Basin and Congo Basin are globally important carbon sinks. 

üåç Since all countries benefit from the ecosystem services of nature, bioeconomy strategies can provide value to countries with different levels of biodiversity and technological development.

üü© For nature-rich countries, transitioning to a bioeconomy offers numerous opportunities for sustainable development by 

üî∫ Creating jobs,¬†
üî∫ Empowering vulnerable communities¬†
üî∫ Driving economic growth. 

üü¢ Vicente Ara√∫jo from the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlights that countries with less biological diversity often have a greater science and innovation capacity that can support the bioeconomy. 

üßÆ Therefore, the bioeconomy presents a broad investment landscape for technology, research and innovation, even for countries with limited natural capital. 

üáßüá∑ Vicente states that Brazil‚Äôs G20 Initiative on Bioeconomy aims to provide the international community with a tool that can help us address a multitude of global challenges. 

üìë A Global Stocktake Report details the bioeconomy strategy and practices of G20 members.

Attended the City of Regina Indigenous Procurement Business Gathering, where the City reaffirmed its commitment to increasing Indigenous participation in procurement. With a 20% target, they‚Äôre actively working to create more opportunities for Indigenous businesses.

On a national level, the Federal Government‚Äôs 5% Indigenous Procurement Policy represents a potential $22.5B annual investment in Indigenous enterprises. While targets haven‚Äôt been fully met, the momentum is undeniable.

Procurement is a powerful tool for economic development, job creation, and self-sufficiency in Indigenous communities. The progress made today will shape a stronger economic future for generations to come. #IndigenousEconomy #Procurement #EconomicDevelopment #IndigenousBusiness #ReconciliationInAction 8 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Parvez Hasan Raihan Proven SEO and Website Specialist | Maximizing Online Revenue for Online Businesses 3w Report this comment How do you envision the future of the Indigenous economy evolving within the framework of Indigenomics, and what steps can we take to amplify its impact further?

‚ÄúInvesting in FNFA‚Äôs bond program aligns with our long-term vision of self-sufficiency and sustainable growth,‚Äù said Chief Angela Levasseur of Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation. ‚ÄúThis investment will enable us to undertake critical projects that enhance the quality of life for our members and promote economic prosperity. Being able to assist in funding Indigenous-led projects across Canada demonstrates our solidarity with all First Nation communities in Canada.‚Äù

Since its inaugural bond issuance in 2014, FNFA has successfully raised over $3 billion in financing for First Nations governments generating an estimate of 30,000 jobs and $6.5 billion to the national economic output while supporting a wide range of projects from public infrastructure and housing to green energy initiatives.

Advancing #IndigenousEconomy & IndigenomicsAI #indigenousAI 1y Edited Report this post The enduring impact of colonization has significantly shaped our modern economic perspectives, leading to displacement and a persistent socio-economic gap among Indigenous peoples. However, the time has come for us to reclaim our narrative and strategically craft a future that aligns with the Indigenous economic worldview.

With the resurgence of business, entrepreneurship, and nation-building, there arises a crucial need for a dedicated space to focus on designing and healing our relationship with money.

üå± Indigenomics DESIGN: Indigenous Wealth Dynamics üå±

Date: June 4th, 2024

This conference serves as a pivotal platform for dialogue on systematically transforming our approach to money, finance, commerce, investment, and capital markets. It is a forum for strategic healing and visionary design critical for the prosperity and sustainability of Indigenous communities.

It didn't take long before I leapt towards Carol Anne Hilton, MBA 's ‚ÄúIndigenomics ‚Äì taking a seat at the table‚Äù and finally got around to reading it this weekend. 

If Economics as a discipline is about understanding behavior around our world‚Äôs limited resources, then Indigenomics should be a field of study on its own under that umbrella. For all economic practitioners. Indigenous lands are estimated to make up around¬†20%¬†of the world‚Äôs territory, containing 80% of its remaining biodiversity (IISD). And, my guess is these are very conservative estimates as they don‚Äôt include unceded lands and territories. 

In 2011, TD Economics estimated that the size of the indigenous economy in Canada would eclipse $32 billion by 2016. That number has since grown 1.5 X ‚Äì expected to reach 100 billion by 2025. And yet, indigenous voices remain excluded (alongside numerous others).

Intersectionality is crucial in storytelling. It‚Äôs also fundamental in building a more connected understanding of the world. Making progress in today‚Äôs world requires us dig into and engage with multiple identities and perspectives simultaneously. Unfortunately, as humans we are wired to seek neatly defined boxes and checklists. It gives us a sense of security and comfort. But we‚Äôre way past the point (or at least should be) of one-dimensional invitations or assigned seats. Representation can‚Äôt be just about proportions because identities are complex and the world we live in requires agility and dynamism. So, perhaps that means that the table and the criteria around it needs to be scrapped, reimagined, and rebuilt, rather than just extended.

While it‚Äôs a broad lens, there is a lot in this work that is transferable. As Hilton says Indigenomics is about ‚Äúour relationship to ourselves, to each other, to the Earth, to our past, and our future‚Äù. 

All in all, this book didn‚Äôt disappoint. One that I wish existed (and was required) when I was a student. I hope it will have follow on work that digs further and more explicitly into the data and policy side of things.

This is the most accurate media coverage about the concerns facing the Indigenous tourism industry that I have read so far.

Key takeaways:

1.  Non Indigenous tourism has surpassed 2019 tourism revenues as of 2023, reaching 113 billion in total revenues.  Was worth an estimated 105 billion in 2019.  
2.  Indigenous tourism remains well below the 2019 economic levels (was our best year ever).  The total is 3.7 billion as of the end of 2023 which remains 8% lower that 2019.  
3. More Indigenous tourism businesses than ever,  but less revenues overall.  
4.  Staffing remains a major challenge and is 5% less than 2019. 
5.  Growth projected due to the high domestic and international visitor demands, but Indigenius tourism will not meet revenues and job creation potential without key investments and still remain below 2019 levels. 
6.  Federal investments for our sector continue to decline and will reach the lowest level of Federal government support for our industry since 2017 in 2025. 

This remains a major concern to our leadership and team Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC) We continue to create solutions but need partners to show tangible support as well.

As of 2019, Indigenous tourism in Canada boasted over 39,000 workers and comprised more than 1,900 Indigenous tourism businesses, contributing $1.9 billion annually to Canada‚Äôs direct GDP (up $1.5 billion in 2017). Moreover, it generated $1.1 billion in wages and salaries, and revenue generated $3.7 billion, showcasing its potential for growth and sustainability.  

More good news! In 2024, Indigenous tourism will  directly contribute a total of $800M in tax revenues to all three levels of government in Canada. 

Indigenous tourism is poised for even greater success. Strategic priorities have been outlined in Canada 365, the 2023 Federal Tourism Growth Strategy, and ITAC‚Äôs ambitious 2030 Vision to make Canada the world leader in Indigenous tourism.

Indigenous-led tourism is transforming Canada's tourism landscape, highlighting the strength and resourcefulness of Indigenous peoples. With a substantial CAD 25 billion investment from the federal government, this sector is set to thrive, offering genuine cultural experiences and promoting sustainable development. The Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC) plays a pivotal role, fostering collaboration among associations, governments, and industry leaders. This growth not only boosts the economy and preserves Indigenous traditions but also fosters reconciliation and self-determination. By 2030, the industry aims to add 85,000 jobs and elevate Canada on the global tourism stage.

Indigenous tourism has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels (in 2019), with inflationary pressures and workforce shortages serving as the key contributors, according to an economic report conducted by the The Conference Board of Canada (CBOC) and the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC) .

The report underscores the critical role Indigenous tourism plays in Canada‚Äôs economy. In 2023, Indigenous tourism directly contributed $1.6 billion to Canada‚Äôs GDP ‚Äì a decrease of 10 per cent compared to 2019, and an even greater decrease of nearly 24 per cent when adjusted for inflation.

Despite the downturn, Indigenous tourism in Canada generated an estimated $3.7 billion in revenues in 2023. Moreover, Indigenous tourism‚Äôs total direct economic impact supported more than 34,700 jobs and contributed close to $730 million in direct government revenue (federal, provincial, and municipal).

‚ÄúLooking ahead to 2025 and beyond, it will be more important than ever for our federal, territorial, and provincial partners to come together and collectively support the ongoing recovery of Indigenous tourism,‚Äù says Keith Henry , CEO and president at ITAC. ‚ÄúThis report highlights the sector‚Äôs positive impact on Canada‚Äôs economy ‚Äì and for Indigenous businesses across the country to thrive and reach pre-pandemic levels, ongoing and long-term investment is vitally important to the sector‚Äôs success.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe tourism sector is also facing greater inflationary pressures than other sectors,‚Äù said Alan Chaffe, PhD , Associate Director of Economic Research at The Conference Board of Canada. ‚ÄúPrices for tourism-related goods and services in 2023 were an estimated 18.8 per cent higher than in 2019‚Äîexceeding the economy-wide inflation rate of 15.5 per cent over the same¬†period.‚Äù

It all started in 2019 when I asked myself, why are scientifically proven, engineered solutions often failing to solve real-world problems?

The answer was clear: they weren‚Äôt human-centered. Social innovation, at its core, is about putting humans and society at the heart of problem-solving. It‚Äôs about understanding needs, building empathy, and co-creating solutions that truly make a difference.

This realization transformed the way I approach challenges and continues to shape my work today.

UNCTAD was created with the goal of ensuring that globalisation left no one behind. From 12-14 June, global leaders will discuss the theme, ‚ÄúCharting a new development course in a changing world.‚Äù This is a call to action for us to reimagine development in the age of polyglobalisation. To adapt to changing times, we need to build a future that is resilient, equitable and sustainable.

The forum opened with a keynote from Ant√≥nio Guterres , Secretary-General, and Rebeca Grynspan , Secretary-General (UNCTAD), followed by a leaders discussion. Over the next days, various heads of state, institutional leaders, and top economists will meet in person to explore new, creative solutions for sustainable development, and to discuss how UNCTAD can continue to make a significant impact.

As I continue to explore the concepts of sustainable development, neuro-inclusive leadership, and equal marketing philosophy, I am deeply appreciative of the opportunities to learn and engage with thought leaders such as Samir Saran, President of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF). His perspectives on global equity, climate justice, and the role of the Global South in reshaping governance systems have been profoundly inspiring.

The recent discussions around the Sustainable Development Impact Meetings 2024 (SDIM24), hosted by the World Economic Forum, further highlight the importance of collective action in addressing global challenges like climate change, social inclusion, and economic equity. These platforms enable meaningful conversations about how we, as global citizens, can contribute to a more just, resilient, and sustainable future. #Samir_Saran is the President of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), one of India‚Äôs leading think tanks focused on shaping global policy debates. His work centers on international relations, climate change, sustainable development, digital transformation, and global governance. Saran has become a prominent voice in advocating for South-South cooperation, which emphasizes partnerships among developing countries to promote sustainable economic and social development. üåç‚ú® #Sustainability # #SustainableDevelopment #EthicalMarketing #ClimateAction #GlobalEquity 4 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Business Today 133,093 followers 2mo Report this post Business Today brings exclusive coverage of the World Economic Forum at Davos, starting 20th January.

As Indigenous peoples, we are not just participants in the economy; we are architects of a system that reflects our interconnectedness, sustainability, and collective prosperity. Economic justice means recognizing our inherent rights, fostering economic reconciliation, and creating pathways for economic sovereignty that benefit all.

We are witnessing a transformative era where Indigenous businesses, entrepreneurs, and nations are reclaiming their rightful place at the economic table. The future is being shaped by Indigenous leadership, collaborative partnerships, and a vision that respects the land, our values, and our people.

Any African ag interventional strategy, regardless of its origin, must prioritize an Afro-regenerative systemic mindset shift as its foundational framework. This is not optional, but indispensable.

Decades of well-intentioned yet flawed interventions,often rooted in colonial ag's legacy of exploitation & dispossession,have yielded limited impact, perpetuating systemic inequalities & ecological degradation.

It's time to acknowledge that:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Business-as-usual approaches, modeled after colonial-era export-oriented ag, have come up short, failing to address the complex, interconnected challenges facing African ag.

2Ô∏è‚É£ External solutions imposed without African ownership & agency, echoing the paternalistic attitudes of colonial powers, have often exacerbated problems,undermining local knowledge & resilienceüíî

3Ô∏è‚É£ Incremental reforms & technical fixes, reminiscent of the ""modernization"" efforts of colonial ag, are insufficient; transformative, systemic change is requiredüî•

Even when regen models are introduced, they often fall short of being truly systemic, neglecting to:

üå±Address the historical power imbalances & injustices perpetuated by colonialism & neoliberalism.

üåø Incorporate African indigenous knowledge,cultural heritage & ancestral wisdom.

üåªPrioritize African-led solutions, self-determination & community-driven development.

By realigning interventions around an Afro-regenerative systemic mindset shift, we can:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Center African voices, perspectives & leadership in ag development, reclaiming the narrative from colonial-era stereotypes

2Ô∏è‚É£ Foster self-determination, community-driven solutions & collective prosperity, redressing the historical injustices of colonial ag

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cultivate Afro-ecological resilience, ensuring sustainable, regen & climate-resilient ag practices,a stark departure from the exploitative practices of colonial ag.

This shift:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Recognizes & respects African indigenous knowledge, cultural heritage, & ancestral wisdom,long suppressed by colonial powers

2Ô∏è‚É£ Addresses the historical injustices & power imbalances perpetuated by colonialism & neoliberalism, acknowledging the ongoing impacts of colonial ag

3Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritizes African-led solutions, self-determination & community-driven development, a radical departure from the top-down approaches of colonial ag

By integrating an Afro-regenerative systemic mindset shift, interventions can:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid perpetuating neocolonialism & extractive practices, instead promoting African-led, Afro-centric solutions

2Ô∏è‚É£ Foster genuine partnerships & collaborations that center African voices & perspectives,rather than imposing external ""expertise""

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cultivate Afro-ecological resilience, ensuring sustainable & regen ag practices, a testament to the ingenuity & resilience of #Africanfarmers .

It's time to co-create a new pathway, one that honours African agency, wisdom & resilience.

Let's amplify Afro-regenerative systemic change! 39 2 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 20,741 followers 3000+ Posts View Profile Follow Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

Passionate about Finance, Sales, and Global Education 5mo Edited Report this post Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending the Economic Reconciliation in the Workplace workshop, part of the Canadian Chamber‚Äôs 2024 Inclusive Growth Dialogue Series üåç, in collaboration with the Greater Nanaimo Chamber of Commerce and Vancouver Island Economic Alliance . Hearing from Erralyn Joseph , Desiree Baker, Kear Portris, and Trevor Cootes, made me realize how essential it is to champion long-term growth through meaningful collaborations. It was an insightful and inspiring event that deepened my understanding of the critical role economic reconciliation plays in advancing inclusive growth.

Here are my three key takeaways:

Economic reconciliation is about actionable change‚ÄîIt‚Äôs more than just inclusion. It‚Äôs about creating sustainable, equitable opportunities for Indigenous communities to thrive through meaningful partnerships and support. ü§ù

Businesses have a pivotal role‚ÄîFrom inclusive hiring practices to supporting Indigenous-led initiatives, organizations have the power to drive lasting change by embedding reconciliation into their culture and operations. üè¢

Education and mentorship are powerful tools‚ÄîInvesting in Indigenous entrepreneurship, providing mentorship, and sharing resources are essential steps toward building a more inclusive and resilient economy. üìö

I‚Äôm excited to take these lessons forward and contribute to tangible progress in my own work. How is your organization advancing economic reconciliation?

It‚Äôs more than a concept‚Äîit‚Äôs a call to action. It‚Äôs about ensuring Indigenous communities have the opportunity to fully participate in and benefit from the economy by breaking down systemic barriers and building meaningful partnerships.

Four key areas for economic reconciliation are:
1Ô∏è‚É£  Partnerships & Collaborations
2Ô∏è‚É£  Capacity Building
3Ô∏è‚É£  Inclusive Policies
4Ô∏è‚É£  Investment in Communities

 Esteemed Colleagues,
 I am embarking on an ambitious and timely book project that aims to redefine the landscape of sustainable development in Africa. Titled ""Transformative Leadership for Reimagining African Futures: Towards Sustainable and Equitable Development,"" this pioneering work will present a bold, interdisciplinary framework for catalyzing transformative change across the African continent. As a scholar and practitioner in the field of African development, I am seeking to tap into the wealth of knowledge, diverse perspectives, and innovative ideas within our global community. I invite you - the experts, scholars, policymakers, and development practitioners - to contribute your insights and expertise to this landmark publication. Some of the key themes and questions we will explore include:
 1. Rethinking Development Paradigms: What are the shortcomings of existing development frameworks in Africa, and how can we design more holistic, equitable, and environmentally-sustainable approaches? 
 2. Harnessing the Power of Transformative Leadership: What are the essential characteristics, competencies, and enabling conditions for African leaders to cultivate a shared vision, empower marginalized communities, and drive systemic change? 
 3. Scaling Up Community-Driven Initiatives: How can we learn from and scale up innovative, community-led projects that harness renewable energy, promote agroecological farming, empower women and youth, and revitalize traditional knowledge systems? 
 4. Forging Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration: How can policymakers, civil society leaders, and community organizers work in tandem to align development efforts with the Sustainable Development Goals?
 5. Advancing Theoretical and Practical Frameworks: How can we synthesize cutting-edge theories from development studies, political economy, environmental science, and leadership studies to develop a transformative new paradigm for African development? If you are passionate about redefining the future of Africa and contributing to this landmark publication, I encourage you to reach out to me directly. I am particularly interested in hearing from those with expertise in any of the aforementioned areas, as well as those who can offer insights from the unique socio-cultural, political, and environmental contexts of different African regions. Together, let us embark on this transformative journey and co-create a bold, visionary framework that will shape the development discourse and inspire tangible change across the African continent. I look forward to your engagement and collaboration. 
 Best regards,

According to our #Scorecard report ( https://bit.ly/3vEuTCX ), representation of First Nations, Inuit, and M√©tis in management positions ‚¨á decreased to 2.4% in 2023 from 2.7% the previous year. Tabatha Bull , President and CEO of the Canadian Council for Indigenous Business emphasizes the importance of understanding why these numbers declined and suggests three ways for corporate Canada to transform their approach to #recruiting and #retaining Indigenous leadership:

üí° 1) Change the decision-making process at the board level. Consider embracing consensus decision-making and recognize that Indigenous Peoples may take time to assess the long-term impact of decisions on future generations.

üí° 2) Focus on recruiting for potential, not just experience. Relying solely on a candidate's years of experience will restrict the pool of Indigenous talent.

üí° 3) Prioritize intentional training and development. Ensure Indigenous hires receive the necessary training to prepare them for leadership roles.

How can industrial policy be used to bring people to jobs, connect people to jobs, or bring jobs to people? What are complementary policies that are necessary to support industrial policy, encourage economic growth and the redistribution of wealth? And how different are the roles of local and national government, in driving investment?

With local development being driven significantly by entrepreneurs, national policy needs to support the local level. Harris Selod emphasised the importance of the 3 Ps (place, productivity and prosperity) and 3 Es (explain the problem; estimate the effects; and ensure all actions are aligned) in promoting development. 7 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET) 20,733 followers 3mo Report this post In her recent‚ÄØinterview with Alliance magazine , Mavis Owusu-Gyamfi , President and CEO of #ACET , shares her vision for Africa's growth and its path to economic transformation:

Amidst the increased dysfunction and collapse of old systems, as well as the loss of ways of life, ecosystems, structures, and perceived stability, there is space for new institutions and ways of seeing and being to emerge.

In this spirit, I am excited to share the latest 'Reality Roundtable' episode of the Great Simplification hosted by my new amazing friend Nate Hagens . It was a privilege to join the thoughtful and inspiring Daniel Christian Wahl and Isabel Carlisle to discuss why 'the future is local' and why the time for bioregioning is now. They each bring decades of wisdom from walking the walk..

I still have SO much to learn about bioregionalism, the literature that was published by the OGs in the 80s and 90s (shout out to David Haenke for sending me stuff on the reg!), what it looks like in practice, and how we grow it without allowing it to be consumed by what Nate likes to call 'the Superorganism.' And am feeling very grateful to be learning with and from incredible colleagues like Nate, Daniel, and Isabel, and you - the amazing regenerative/bioregional community. This conversation reflects some of what I've learned - but also so much of what I have left to learn and look forward to learning together!

I would love to hear what questions this conversation brings up for you and what questions on bioregionalism you might like to explore together. Thank you for your enthusiasm in collectively growing bioregional and regenerative economics movements! https://lnkd.in/gukKN-Wb #bioregioning #bioregionalism #regenerativeeconomies #biofi #regeneration 176 14 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 185 followers View Profile Connect Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

It is created by the economic and social systems that we have designed for ourselves, the institutions and concepts that make up these systems are the result of decision made by human beings.

Pursuing a PhD in India is not just a test of academic endurance but also a financial struggle for many scholars. The prolonged duration of PhD programs, coupled with irregular or insufficient fellowships, forces many to take up odd jobs just to make ends meet. This not only hampers their research focus but also highlights the urgent need for better financial support systems. It's time to address these challenges and ensure that our scholars can dedicate themselves fully to their research without the burden of financial insecurity. #PhDScholar #ResearchMatters #FinancialSupport #HigherEducation #India Your opinion on such state of scholars? https://lnkd.in/gAupcpEs Nationalist on Instagram: ""- Google and you will find my..... - Your shop, right?? - No, my research papers on Bio-technology. #india #biotechnology #sad #but #reality"" instagram.com 14 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in IRANZ Independent Research Association of New Zealand 916 followers 9mo Report this post HERA: Which matters more? Excellence or impact? HERA CEO Dr Troy Coyle (Wahine/She/Her) writes about the differences between excellent research that has impact vs impactful research that is excellent, and the potentially harmful bias in the New Zealand Science System. It's a timely article and a discussion we have been having ourselves at IRANZ as we prepared our submission for the Science System Advisory Group in May.

""The Aotearoa New Zealand research, science and innovation (RSI) system is one that purportedly values and rewards research excellence and research impact equally.

""Despite this, the current system favours an approach that focuses on excellent research that has impact vs impactful research that is excellent.""

Dr Coyle writes that an alternative approach is to ensure that all proposals are assessed for both impact and excellence or that impact is the first hurdle. ""Surely, all research must be high impact? Is there any point doing the most excellent research in the world if it has no impact?"" #ResearchExcellence #ImpactfulResearch #ScienceDebate #ResearchImpact #NZScience #SciencePolicy #RSI #InnovationNZ #ScienceSystem #HighImpactResearch #ScienceDiscussion #ResearchMatters #ExcellenceVsImpact #HERA #iranzresearch https://lnkd.in/gaUT___z Which matters more?

As part of the Team Finland Knowledge funded project ‚ÄúFostering green transition through mobility and effective communication between Finnish and Chilean HEIs ‚Äú starting in 2022, we have been building Finnish-Chilean partnership to foster academic exchange, research collaboration, and sustainable innovation in the field of bioeconomy.

Project highlights:
‚Ä¢ Chilean academics visited Finland to explore education programs, industry practices, and research opportunities.
‚Ä¢ Finnish experts travelled to Chile, engaging in bioeconomy seminars, student exchange agreements, and circular bioeconomy development discussions.
‚Ä¢ Workshops, webinars, and vide variety of visits connected professionals, educators, and students to strengthening bioeconomy education.

GreenMOBECO project ended at the end of 2024, but collaboration is continuing in several ways, such as student and staff exchange and joint project applications.

Researchers from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a deep understanding of local contexts and strong relationships with policymakers, yet they contribute to only two percent of global research output. To address this, initiatives like CEGA's Global Networks program and J-PAL's Scholars Program are enhancing inclusion in and building capacity of impact evaluation by providing training, mentorship, and funding to LMIC scholars.

Launched in 2021, the Digital Agricultural Innovations and Services Initiative (DAISI), managed jointly by CEGA and J-PAL, supports research aimed at enhancing digital agricultural solutions for small-scale producers in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The DAISI Regional Scholars Program offers PhD holders from these regions opportunities for funding and mentorship in impact evaluation methodologies.

On October 17th, the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty brings attention to the ongoing global struggle against poverty and calls for collective action. This year‚Äôs theme, ‚ÄúEnding Social and Institutional Maltreatment,‚Äù urges us to address not only economic hardship but also the social and institutional barriers that perpetuate poverty.

Since its recognition by the United Nations in 1992, this day has amplified the voices of those affected by poverty to ensure fair access to education, employment, and essential services, which are vital for building more inclusive societies.

However, fight against poverty is not limited to lack of basic needs anymore. It is about the underlying absence of opportunities, freedom of choice and participation in decision making. Achieving SDG 1 refers to the idea of equal and equitable access to resources that envisions a future where all communities have a fair chance to grow and succeed.

By working together, we can create a society where every individual has the opportunity to thrive. As development practitioners, it is essential to take shared responsibility, to bring affirmative changes for a better future.

The fight against poverty is far from over. The 2024 UN SDG Report highlights the critical need for action to close the gaps in social protection and climate resilience. 

With millions still facing extreme poverty, especially in vulnerable regions, the path forward demands focused efforts to support those most affected. 

Let‚Äôs come together to address these challenges and create a future where no one is left behind. #EndPoverty #SDGGoals #GlobalInequality #SustainableFuture #ClimateAction #SocialImpact #UNReport2024 4 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Stuart M.

 Established by the United Nations in 1992, it commemorates a 1987 gathering in #Paris where over 100,000 people honored victims of poverty. The day aims to promote dialogue between those living in poverty and society, emphasizing that poverty is a violation of #humanrights . 

Activities include raising awareness, supporting anti-poverty organizations, and advocating for #policy changes to combat #poverty , #violence and #hunger globally


In December 1995, the United Nations General #Assembly proclaimed the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997‚Äì2006), following the #Copenhagen Social Summit. UNESCO 's involvement in the fight against poverty on October 17 emphasizes the importance of #education , #science , and #cultural #initiatives as tools for #empowerment . 

By promoting #capacity building, UNESCO supports individuals in overcoming poverty through #skills #development and #creative #economies , which foster employment and dignity.

(2008) identified a significant negative correlation between nitrogen fertilizer use and bird species richness. Birds in agricultural landscapes are more likely to decline due to cascading ecological impacts of high fertilizer use, such as reduced plant and insect diversity and eutrophication of aquatic habitats. However, increasing the area of semi-natural habitats (e.g., hedgerows and uncultivated margins) in agricultural landscapes can mitigate these negative effects by providing alternative resources and habitats for birds.

First created by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in¬†1993, IDB is a celebration of biological diversity‚Äîa day to educate and bring awareness to biodiversity issues worldwide.

Biodiversity¬†encompasses all the different living things found in an area, including animals, insects, fungi, plant life, and microorganisms. This complex mix of life is a delicate balance, as every organism relies on others to survive. 

Great Ecology engages with practices of strengthening biodiversity through our projects. We lead the way in creative solutions for ecological problems, working with clients to preserve biological diversity in the face of complex environmental issues.

We are also looking to improve sites that are close to people and have them involved with the creation and ongoing low-key management.

¬†
Key take away thoughts to consider were:
- Diversity on boards in terms of both gender and skillset is important.
- Skills in governance as well as financial literacy are essential to be present on boards. In addition, skills in life sciences provide an important balance.
- The discussion around prior board experience vs skillset, provided some food for thought on whether prior board experience is always needed, if the skillset is a good fit.
- ‚ÄúBoard observer‚Äù opportunities could help aspiring board members gain the boardroom experience needed to be considered for future positions

However, those companies continue to grow their share of capital raised. https://lnkd.in/giZGy6Yg According to a report by the McKinsey Institute and the World Economic Forum,¬†investing in women's health can boost the global economy by $1 trillion annually by 2040‚Äîa 1.7 percent increase in the average per capita GDP generated by women.

My guest tomorrow on She Leads Biotech is President & CEO of Invivo Biosciences , Ayla Annac . whose journey¬†takes us from her roots in Turkey to her pioneering work in the biotech space, where she's making strides in heart disease treatment.

Ayla is a passionate advocate for increasing female representation at all levels in biotech. 

She believes that diversity in leadership, especially from women, brings essential perspectives and drives collaboration over competition. 

Her commitment to mentorship and supporting other women in science is a testament to her belief in lifting others as she climbs. 9 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Kintiga 6,845 followers 3mo Report this post Last night, we had the privilege of attending BioIndustry Association (BIA) 's Women in Biotech event in London, with Marianne Lambertson and Karina Tatagiba Gon√ßalves representing the MAP Group. The event highlighted the challenges faced by female founders and the ongoing barriers for women in leadership roles within the life sciences sector.
¬†
We were honoured to participate and contribute to the conversation about driving positive change in the industry. One CEO and founder shared a striking experience: of the 100+ venture capital firms she approached, over 60% suggested appointing a male CEO to improve her chances of success.
¬†
Another key takeaway was that only about one-third of grant funding in the UK is allocated to female-founded organisations. The panel discussion explored actionable steps we can take now and in the future to support women-led initiatives.

Thank you to BIA for hosting such an inspiring event‚Äîwe look forward to connecting with colleagues at future opportunities. #WomenInBiotech #BIA #LifeSciences #WomenInLeadership 129 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Observer Research Foundation 91,513 followers 6mo Report this post Observer Research Foundation and Reliance Foundation , in collaboration with United Nations in India , are delighted to launch the report ""The Next Frontier: Charting the Contours of the Post-2030 Development Agenda""!

The answer is yes! I figured I would share here too for those who are interested in foresight but perhaps not yet as connected to the wonderful foresight community. 

There are two online events coming up in early May that I have my eye on:

May 1, 2024, 9am EST: Enhancing Women's Leadership In and Through Foresight by Global Foresight Advisory Council (GFAC) This should be a great panel discussion! 
Moderator: Thays Prado
Panelists: Zan Chandler, B√°rbara Ferrer Lanz, and Kelsey Volkmann.
Free registration here: https://lnkd.in/g-3HcsCN May 7-9, 2024: Policy Horizons Canada - Horizons de politiques Canada (the federal government's strategic foresight department) Futures Week
29 speakers over 3 days!
Anyone can register and attend: https://lnkd.in/gSBCkxDM For those who are new to or just starting to learn about foresight: You don't need to be a foresight practitioner to attend these events. If you need that little confidence boost, remind yourself that no one is an expert about the future, but everyone (including you) has expertise that is important to the future. You are not just welcome, you are vital.

When I founded the Boma Prize for Africa, my mission was clear: to empower and uplift the most innovative minds across the continent that will eventually put Africans on the global map. But the path has not been without its storms.

In this picture, I hold a cup that symbolizes more than just a beverage; it represents the fuel that drives my passion and determination every single day. From day one, my faith has been my cornerstone. As Romans 8:31 reminds us, ‚ÄúIf God is for us, who can be against us?‚Äù This belief has fortified me through every obstacle, ensuring that I never lose sight of my purpose.

Unstoppable people carry a spirit that propels them beyond their limits. As Philippians 4:13 says, ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚Äù This verse is a testament to the strength that fuels my journey. Despite the challenges, despite the setbacks, I continue to push forward. The Boma Prize for Africa is now a little over a month away, and every day brings new hurdles. Yet, every day also brings new victories.

Starting this initiative was not just about creating an event; it was about building a platform for change, for innovation, and for growth. The support from our sponsors and the community has been incredible, reinforcing my belief that together, we can achieve greatness.

As we approach the event, I am reminded of the power of perseverance. The storms have come, but they have only made me stronger.

We're thrilled to share some exciting news with you. First,  Public Art Africa is no longer a separate organization from ur4Africa though it has always been a subsidiary of UR4Africa , we are basically condensing platforms for effective management and to improve our productivity, UR4Africa oversees PAA as one of the projects under her.

WHAT IS UR4AFRICA?
UR4Africa Project, Inc., founded in 2013, is a pan-African space that creates a pathway for the global African diaspora to collaborate with African people to uplift Africa. 

As a registered 501c(3) organization, it is our intention to curate intersectional opportunities for people interested in community building, skill-sharing, investment, and exchanging positive stories about the continent of Africa. To achieve this, we initiated: public Art Africa project, The Exchange Program, The Think Tank and the Public Awareness Service.

Our vision for Public Art Africa is to create programs to engage and educate young minds, preparing them for the future by nurturing and harnessing their talents through active and quality mentorship.

The Exchange Program facilitates cross-cultural exchange and collaborations between individuals and organizations across Africa. Last year, we had a collaboration with OLA ( Otherwise Life For All) in Benin Republic, West Africa. we're also excited to welcome a volunteer from France, and many others.

Public Service Awareness
Our PSA initiatives focus on creating awareness through contents that reflect the beauty of Africa and that has the capacity to drive positive changes in Africa. 

The Think Tank
The Think Tank is a platform for critical thinking, and discourse of pressing issues facing Africa today. It is a team of different individuals from different fields to generate innovative solutions and ideas to address some of the continent's challenges, membership into this is completely free, you can jump in with just a mail.

Each of the programs are guided by shared purpose and the big picture is to connect Africans, build Africa and redefine the narrative through the spirit of Pan-Africanism. By ""pan-Africanism"" we refer to  the movement that aims to promote solidarity, unity, and cooperation among people of African descent, regardless of their geographic location.

üá™üá∫ I address the tension between the EU‚Äôs mutual benefits narrative and its commitment to partner country ownership

üá∑üáº After which I introduce Rwanda‚Äôs philosophy of Agaciro as an idea worth reflecting on. #GlobalGateway #EUAfrica #Agaciro Friends of Europe 23,396 followers 1y Edited ‚ùùThe Global Gateway Initiative can only be truly mutually beneficial if its projects are, at the very least, co-led by its partners.‚ùû

‚û°Ô∏è On its second anniversary last December, the European Union‚Äôs Global Gateway Initiative reached a milestone with the inauguration of BioNTech‚Äôs mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.

‚û°Ô∏è As the site targets development objectives and geopolitical priorities shared by both the EU and the African Union alike, it looks like a textbook example of what a ‚Äòmutually beneficial partnership‚Äô between Europe and Africa should look like.

‚ùì Does this mean all such initiatives are equally balanced to the benefit of both partners? Not necessarily. 

‚û°Ô∏è Moving forward, the Global Gateway should provide its African partners with more institutional guarantees for ownership, enabling a more equal partnership where countries less resistant to pressure from donors enjoy this same sense of dignity.

We‚Äôre happy to share another example of the many ways TIC companies work together and rely on each other to deliver projects for our clients.

T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´ Property Management is working on Phase 8 of the T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´ Government's Rapid Housing initiative - these tiny homes have just arrived and are waiting to make their journey to Wekwe√®t√¨ on the T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´ Winter Road being built by T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´ Engineering & Environmental Services (TEES)!

The largest building belongs to another TG project; the Gam√®t√¨ Family Centre (building in tyvek wrap) is one step closer to becoming an important facility after making its own Winter Road trip!

Awesome to build capacity and homes for the community. Such an important aspect of what TIC does. #indigenousbusiness #indigenomics #esg #community #mining #naturaldiamonds #yellowknife #nwt 116 4 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter smallCAP Infographics Accredited Investor | Infographic & Marketing Specialist | Enhancing Investor Communications for Small-Cap Companies 1mo Report this comment Congrats Paul!

EF-Tu \(elongation factor thermo unstable\) is a prokaryotic elongation factor responsible for catalyzing the binding of an aminoacyl-tRNA \(aa-tRNA\) to the ribosome. It is a G-protein, and facilitates the selection and binding of an aa-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome. As a reflection of its crucial role in translation, EF-Tu is one of the most abundant and highly conserved proteins in prokaryotes.

Click here for the full article: https://bit.ly/4dgYdiB In 1971, the financial world changed forever with the advent of science-based investing. Research from academics like Gene Fama revealed that markets efficiently price in all available information, making traditional stock-picking ineffective. This breakthrough paved the way for index funds and the democratization of investing, allowing anyone to capture market returns without speculation. Today, Dimensional Investing builds on these principles, offering investors low-cost, diversified portfolios that go beyond indexing. #Investing #FinancialScience #IndexFunds #GeneFama #LongTermInvesting #WealthManagement 1 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Indigenomics 4,887 followers 5mo Edited Report this post The $100 billion Indigenous economy is no longer just a goal‚Äîit‚Äôs a reality being built today!

Women are key players in the food system, yet they often lack the recognition and resources they need. 

In the Mediterranean region, women contribute significantly to greening food systems. From producers and innovators to decision-makers, they are essential in driving sustainable practices. Despite structural barriers, their leadership ensures resilience and inclusivity. However, women's contributions are often undervalued, particularly due to unpaid agricultural work and involvement in informal or shadow agri-food labour market.¬†Recognizing and supporting their role is vital for a greener future.

In Europe, women are transforming agriculture through innovative practices that prioritize sustainability and environmental stewardship. As key players in the green transition, they‚Äôre driving the adoption of agroecological methods, fostering biodiversity, and reducing agriculture's carbon footprint. Yet, they face challenges in accessing resources and decision-making spaces.

Empowering women is essential for creating a more resilient and sustainable food system. Discover more about women‚Äôs pivotal role in sustainable agriculture and join the movement for change!

When I first set out on this journey, I had a simple goal: read one book a month to sharpen my skills as an entrepreneur. But somewhere along the way, I realized this was bigger than just reading. I wasn‚Äôt just consuming knowledge‚ÄîI was collecting it, curating it, and applying it to build something greater: Indigpreneur.

As Indigenous people, our knowledge has always been passed down through stories, teachings, and lived experience. Today, books have become another way for me to learn from those who came before us‚Äîleaders, thinkers, and changemakers who have built businesses, disrupted industries, and reshaped economies.

üìñ Starting with ‚ÄúIndigenomics: Taking a Seat at the Economic Table‚Äù by Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D This book isn‚Äôt just a read‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint. Hilton lays out how Indigenous people can reclaim economic power, create wealth in our communities, and move beyond surviving to thriving in business. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder that we don‚Äôt need to fit into existing systems‚Äîwe can build our own.

üöÄ How Indigpreneur Will Implement These Teachings:

‚úÖ Building Indigenous-Led Networks: Indigenomics highlights the need for strong Indigenous business ecosystems. Through Indigpreneur, I‚Äôm focused on creating a network where Indigenous entrepreneurs collaborate, share resources, and grow together.

‚úÖ Creating Wealth, Not Just Jobs: Hilton talks about the importance of ownership. Indigpreneur isn‚Äôt just about helping Indigenous businesses start‚Äîit‚Äôs about helping them scale, sustain, and create long-term wealth in our communities.

‚úÖ Elevating Indigenous Innovation: Indigenous knowledge and ways of doing business are an advantage, not a limitation. I want Indigpreneur to champion modern Indigenous business models‚Äîones rooted in our values, but thriving in today‚Äôs economy.

üì¢ This isn‚Äôt just about me‚Äîit‚Äôs about all of us. If you‚Äôre an Indigenous entrepreneur, business leader, or changemaker, let‚Äôs connect and share knowledge.

üèÜ Join the Indigenous Entrepreneur Roundtable

At the end of this month, I‚Äôm hosting a roundtable discussion where we‚Äôll explore how we can take action on these ideas, share insights, and connect as Indigenous entrepreneurs.

Thanks to tech and AI, this goal is within reach!
¬†
This year‚Äôs Summit of the Future by the International Telecommunication Union and UNDP is a powerful reminder that we need to put ourselves back on a better path. We are not on track to meet the goals we have set for our global community, and new challenges are already on the horizon.

This is especially true for health and care: our systems are creaking under ever-growing pressures, and the pace at which inequities are growing appears to outrun the speed of innovation. But there is hope.
¬†
I was delighted to take the stage and speak about the transformative potential that AI and advanced analytics bring to health and care. These tools can help us identify the true drivers of health and equip decision makers with the insights they need to design impactful interventions ‚Äì ultimately keeping us all healthy in the first place.

On September 24, the Novartis Foundation will reveal such AI-driven insights on potential determinants of heart health in New York City, doing our part in paving the way to a healthier and more equitable tomorrow.

Kronner's insights centered around how AI is a transformative tool empowering staff and seniors in everything from streamlining daily tasks to enabling collaborative decision-making. The key? Thoughtful, personalized integration that respects individual autonomy while enhancing quality of life.

The packed session and expanded space sent a clear message: The senior living industry is embracing technological innovation like never before.

During the Canada-Italy Forum on AI & Well-Being, I had the opportunity to present ""Multi-modal modeling of Eye Imaging to predict Dementia in the CALLIOPE Urban Health Initiative"". This innovative approach leverages AI-driven algorithms and angio-OCT imaging to detect novel retinal biomarkers, offering a non-invasive, cost-effective way to classify neurocognitive diseases such as Alzheimer's.

üî¨ By combining retinal imaging with data from clinical, lifestyle, and socio-economic factors, we aim to:
- Improve early detection of dementia.
- Enhance prediction models using machine learning and multi-modal data fusion.
- Pave the way for integrative health solutions in urban contexts.

This work underscores the potential of technology and interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the global dementia challenge, with over 50 million people affected today‚Äîa number expected to surpass 74 million by 2030.

AI Med Global Summit Conference! I'll be sharing the stage with these rockstar leaders in healthcare: Susan Sly and Lisa Larkin MD FACP NCMP Together, we're diving into a vital discussion on ""Population Health and Equity: Leveraging AI to Overcome Data Disparities in Women's Health.""

This topic couldn't be more crucial as it sits at the intersection of technology and healthcare, addressing some of the most pressing issues faced by women across the globe. Our focus will be on how artificial intelligence can bridge gaps in healthcare data, improve access, and deliver more equitable health outcomes for women everywhere. üöÄ

I'm looking forward to exploring innovative solutions and strategies with my fellow panelists, as we delve into the ways AI can transform healthcare practices, making them more inclusive and effective. Join us as we tackle these challenges head-on, aiming to make a meaningful impact on healthcare systems worldwide. üåç

Bilal A Mateen 's opening remarks about the threats of removing humans from the center of AI framed the conversations nicely, and closing remarks from Alain Labrique drove the point home by asking not ""how"" AI should be used, but rather ""if"" - a question that is best answered only when the problem is well-defined, the target/recipient population has decreased barriers to access (like compute power! H/t Agnes Kiragga ), and the foundational models used are very very _very_ well-understood. Curious to hear how funding organizations are creating AI-forward grant strategies, and how/if they are incorporating lessons learned by #digitalhealth / #tech4dev implementers over the past few decades.

On June 2nd, PATH and Digital Square at PATH convened at the 3rd Meeting of the G20 Brasil 2024 Health Working Group for a co-branded event, ""AI for Science & Health: Ensuring Equitable Impact."" Supported by the Wellcome Trust and co-hosted with the World Health Organization , GIDH, and the World Economic Forum , the event addressed how artificial intelligence (AI) can transform healthcare, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Discussions covered:
ü§ñ The role of AI in improving clinical decision support and medical product development
üåç The importance of localizing digital innovations to benefit the Global South
‚ö† Overcoming challenges such as algorithm biases, data quality issues, and privacy concerns

Pictured below, Ana Estela Haddad , Secretary for Information and Digital Health for the Brazilian Ministry of Health, spoke to Brazil‚Äôs perspective on how the G20 can help facilitate and harness the potential of AI in LMICs: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that we work collaboratively together and with responsibility, especially when we think about ethical use of AI‚Ä¶ and that we keep on working on an equitable way to develop strength in our health systems.‚Äù

Our collective goal is to channel AI's potential while ensuring ethical considerations and equitable access to healthcare innovations. This event was a significant step towards a future where AI-driven solutions support global health equity. üåêü©∫ #G20Health #AI4Health #GlobalHealthEquity #DigitalHealth #DigitalTransformation 10 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in LAMIA RAHAL Woman founder I Health tech I Strategy I Public policy I Government affairs I Regulatory affairs | market access | Business development I 2mo Report this post We‚Äôre thrilled to announce Health Nexus Africa membership to the HealthAI - The Global Agency for Responsible AI in Health Community of Practice ‚Äî a global forum where diverse voices come together to turn ideas into action and advance #ResponsibleAI governance in health.

It makes more sense to back known and understood mineral deposits first before exploring for entirely new plays. 

In South Africa, prospectors have it easier than most mining jurisdictions, as we have access to historical prospecting, exploration and mining data over the country‚Äôs over 100-year plus mining history. Martin Vydra Strategist and Advisor - Nickel & Cobalt - Mine to Market 2mo While this is great for raising awareness in the sector, we really do not need to ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù new deposits.  There are lots of great deposits that have been ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù decades ago, just not deemed ‚Äúeconomic‚Äù by the spreadsheet engineers.  Kobold is looking for the next ‚Äúhome run‚Äù ball, another Voiseys or equivalent.  Good hunting, but we don‚Äôt need more funding for exploration.  We need funding for development of the known deposits.  That‚Äôs what China did.  In the 1990‚Äôs Indonesian ore was considered too low grade/quality for Western producers.  See where we are now‚Ä¶..

As the Founder of Tipi Horse, I am incredibly proud of our work in helping foster meaningful Indigenous engagement and cultural awareness within Northwestern Ontario‚Äôs growing mining sector.

Thunder Bay is quickly becoming a key service and supply hub, supporting 9 active mines and over 18 exploration projects. Tipi Horse is honoured to be part of this expanding industry, where we are working to bridge the gap between mining operations and Indigenous communities. Through our Indigenous cultural awareness training and commitment to building respectful, sustainable partnerships, we help ensure that Indigenous voices are heard and their rights respected in the resource development process.

üí° What Tipi Horse Brings to the Table:
‚úîÔ∏è Indigenous-Owned Business: As an Indigenous woman-owned company, we‚Äôre deeply rooted in our cultural values and community connections.
‚úîÔ∏è Cultural Awareness Training: We offer tailored training programs that educate and engage the mining sector on Indigenous history, culture, and protocols, helping foster stronger, more respectful relationships.
‚úîÔ∏è Building Partnerships: We‚Äôre committed to ensuring that partnerships between Indigenous communities and the mining sector are built on trust, mutual respect, and shared benefits.

I was honoured last week to have met Minister Greg Rickford, Ontario‚Äôs Minister of Northern Development and Minister of Indigenous Affairs, to discuss the future of mining and regional development. It was a privilege to be part of such important conversations, and I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to contribute to shaping the future of mining in our region.

üëè Tipi Horse is proud to be included in the Thunder Bay Community Economic Development Commission (CEDC) Mining Directory, and I encourage everyone to celebrate and support Indigenous-owned businesses like ours, which are leading the way in creating positive change in the mining sector. #IndigenousBusiness #IndigenousEngagement #CulturalAwareness #TipiHorse #ThunderBay #Mining #NorthwesternOntario #CEDC #GregRickford #Gold #Palladium #Lithium #SupportIndigenous #SustainableMining #CommunityPartnerships #WBECanada #weconnect #CCIB #CCAB #womanownedbusiness 55 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Peter Mhone Geologist at Zambia Gold Company 4mo Edited Report this post CSR's role in sustainable mining as far as communities are concerned is of paramount importance as long as the needs of the communities are met.

Remember Theranos? Elizabeth Holmes promised revolutionary blood-testing technology and dazzled everyone with confidence and ambition. But behind the scenes, the tech didn‚Äôt work. When the truth came out, trust crumbled, and the fallout was massive‚Äînot just for the company but for everyone who believed in it.¬† 

Now, look at Cotopaxi. They‚Äôve built their brand differently, with purpose and transparency at the core.

Trying to build connections on false faces or exaggerated pretenses is like laying a foundation on quicksand. It might hold for a moment, but it won‚Äôt last.

¬†
Zed has been a cornerstone of Prospect‚Äôs journey since its inception, serving as a founding director and guiding the company through transformative milestones. Under his stewardship, Prospect assembled a robust portfolio of exploration assets, leading to the discovery and development of the Arcadia Lithium Project - a globally recognised, top-ten hard rock lithium asset.
¬†
Zed‚Äôs strategic vision played a pivotal role in Prospect‚Äôs evolution, from the discovery of Arcadia to its successful sale to Huayou Cobalt in 2022. His leadership also helped establish the company in Zambia, culminating in the acquisition of the Mumbezhi Copper Project, which underpins our current growth trajectory.
¬†
Non-Executive Chairperson Mark Wheatley shared:
‚ÄúI would like to take this opportunity to thank Zed for all his efforts over the past 11 years. Zed has been a sage Director of the Company, and the board has valued his experience, leadership and calm approach to business through what has been a transformative growth period for the Company. I have really enjoyed working with him.‚Äù
¬†
‚ÄúZed has always been relied on to provide an external perspective and independent judgment towards the needs of our shareholders. He now feels comforted that the company is on a steady and progressive pathway with Mumbezhi Copper Project which provides a responsible opportunity for renewal at Board level.‚Äù 
¬†
‚ÄúWe wish Zed every success with his personal ventures and wish to express our most sincere gratitude for his dedication and service as a Non-Executive to Prospect Resources‚Äù
¬†
As Zed transitions into the next chapter of his journey, we honour his legacy and remain committed to the progressive pathway he helped establish.

Another incredible GAIA meeting, and I‚Äôm forever in awe of the amazing women in this group. We all come from different backgrounds and experiences, yet we are bonded by common values‚Äîrespect for one another, humanity, and the desire to become better leaders both personally and professionally.

Every session brings those ""aha"" moments that leave me inspired. This week, we dived into Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs). While everything we discuss is, of course, confidential, my biggest takeaway is powerful‚Äîno one is chasing money. We‚Äôre all focused on something far more meaningful: creating a wider social impact and improving the lives of those around us.

The genuine connections we build in GAIA don't happen without this kind of engagement. It‚Äôs different from being with friends, and these are conversations you just can‚Äôt have with colleagues. 

If you're interested in what GAIA is and how you can be a part of it, drop me a DM, and we can set up a short call to see if there's a good mutual fit.

Thank you again to these phenomenal women for your trust and belief in GAIA.

This month, we honor the vibrant cultures, traditions, and contributions of the Latinx community, recognizing the resilience and strength that define this diverse group. It‚Äôs also a time to embrace the call to action for courageous love and solidarity against the challenges faced by marginalized communities.

At Transformation by Design, we are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued. This Latinx Heritage Month, let‚Äôs:
üìñ Educate Ourselves: Dive deeper into the histories and stories of the Latinx community.
üéâ Celebrate Diversity: Highlight and celebrate the achievements of Latinx individuals within and outside our organization.
‚úä Stand in Solidarity: Support policies and initiatives that promote equity and justice for all.

Our mission is simple:

‚ú® To uplift women.
‚ú® To inspire leadership.

If you want to go far, go together"" - African Proverb.

I was privileged to attend the Thrive Women's Summit organized by the Women Power House led by Faith Fetaru .

Here‚Äôs what stood out for me:
üåπ The importance of collaboration and how it impacts the growth of a business or organization, shared by Henriette Paula Mugisa, Belinda Esaete Regina, and Constansia Nakinda:
üìå Tapping into each other's already established market.
üìå Reaching more people and creating greater impact.
üìå Widening networks.
üìå Learning from each other.
üìå Helping each other achieve their vision.

üåπ Every woman is a queen in her kingdom and has 7 powers, as explained by Jacqueline Asiimwe :
üìå Power of Purpose: Why are you still alive? Why were you born?
üìå Power of People: Who are the people attached to your purpose? The people you are meant to serve‚Äîhow do you treat them?
üìå Power of Place: Where do you want to create impact? Is it in your professional space, family, or your community?
üìå Power of Privilege: What privileges do you have that can support your purpose? Is it your personality, education, background, experiences, or exposure?
üìå Power of Pleasure: What brings you satisfaction and joy? How often do you make time for it‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a hobby, self-care, or a passion?
üìå Power of Purse: What are your financial habits? What‚Äôs your generosity quotient? How are you managing the resources you have?
üìå Power of Pain: How do you deal with your pain? Does it control you, or are you using it for your good?

üåπ Every person is a leader, and your purpose is your area of leadership! Betty Ogiel highlighted the 3A‚Äôs of leadership:
üìå Assess: Who are you? What are your strengths, weaknesses, and purpose?
üìå Accept: After self-assessment, accept who you are. Change what you can and accept what you cannot.
üìå Action: There‚Äôs no change or transformation without action. Take action!

What‚Äôs your takeaway from what I‚Äôve shared above? #ThriveWomensSummit #womenempowerment #womensupportingwomen #women #girls #mothers Arinda Mothers Empowerment Foundation 37 4 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 4,887 followers View Profile Connect Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

Hosted by Business Today Executive Director Rahul Kanwal, this conversation unpacks the concept of a ""Geopolitical Recession"" and explores how the world must prepare for it. Brende sheds light on the economic, political, and technological dynamics reshaping global landscapes, from rising geopolitical tensions and economic disparities to the transformative power of AI, green energy, and international collaboration. As global institutions face the challenge of navigating an era of polarization and uncertainty, Brende discusses the strategies businesses, governments, and societies need to adopt for a more sustainable and equitable future. This must-watch interview answers critical questions: Can international cooperation thrive amidst fragmentation? What opportunities and threats do emerging technologies bring? How will the geopolitical and economic shifts affect businesses and individuals?

¬†
We discussed how much Davos‚Äîand the world‚Äîhas changed since 1999. Back then, optimism about European integration, globalisation, and the tech boom shaped the discussions. Today, in 2025, we stand at a crossroads: faced with climate urgency, AI governance, and deepening inequalities, leaders must choose between collaboration or fragmentation, action or inaction.
¬†
Martin shared memories of Davos 2000 when President Clinton became the first sitting U.S. president to attend. His visit symbolised a belief in global cooperation, which is much like what we‚Äôre striving for today.
That same year, the GAVI Alliance was launched at Davos, a partnership that has since saved millions of lives by ensuring vaccine access worldwide.
¬†
That moment felt like a parallel to today: the stakes are high, but so is the potential for impact. I see this daily in my work, primarily through partnerships with healthcare companies and philanthropic foundations‚Äîorganisations whose commitment to global health and equity continues to drive real change.
¬†
My Davos moment this year? Realising that while the world has changed, the power of collaboration and partnerships remains just as strong. #WEF25 #Leadership #Collaboration #Partnerships #GlobalHealth #Hope 112 4 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in unDavos Summit 2,295 followers 2mo Edited Report this post üåç Behind the Curtains of Davos: A World Beyond the Forum

Ogen's message was clear: First Nations are determined to be active participants in shaping their own futures. They seek partnerships built on respect, trust, and a shared vision for economic prosperity.
 
The Cedar LNG project, spearheaded by the Haisla Nation , stands as a groundbreaking example of Indigenous ownership in the LNG sector. The Coastal GasLink pipeline offered First Nations along its route a 10% equity stake, ensuring long-term revenue streams, procurement opportunities, jobs, and training.

First Nations communities must lead the way in Ontario's bioeconomy. Jason Rasevych, president of the Anishnawbe Business Professional Association (Northern Ontario) , powerfully stated at the Scaling Up Bioeconomy Conference | #ScalingUpBio that First Nations need to have ownership and leadership roles in this growing sector.

Why? Because they hold inherent rights to the land and its resources. Their traditional knowledge and practices are vital for sustainable resource management.

Late last year I had the opportunity to travel to Australia with the Tlicho Chiefs to tour some of Fortescue‚Äôs operations and to meet with various Indigenous groups that Fortescue works with throughout their operations. It was truly an inspiring trip with a great company that lives and breathes its values. 

Earlier this week while at the AME Roundup show Tlicho Government signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Fortescue to assist in developing the Tlicho lands for future mineral development ( https://lnkd.in/gjAD8DTP ). Truly a groundbreaking moment as the nation continues to move forward and develop its economic future. I for one could not be more proud to work with this group and help build a robust economy for the region.

He also goes on to say to keep a close eye on Wildcat Resources , which is growing a major lithium discovery in the Pilbara region of WA. Its Tabba Tabba Lithium Project has the potential for an ~80Mt lithium resource at 0.5% Li2O cut-off, with a whopping 100,000m of drilling planned for this year.

In today's world where information moves at lightning speed, integrity has never been more paramount. Our character depends on it and so does our organisation‚Äôs culture.

At Artis Biotech, we think of integrity not just as a policy but as a practice too. This is seen in how we deal with our customers, partners and colleagues. We ensure that actions speak louder than words by maintaining the highest standards.

My key takeaways from attending for the first time last week: 

üçª Satellite events are where the real value is. We spent time on the exhibition floor and at satellite events, and hands down, made more meaningful connections at satellite events. This was because most people on the conference floor were salespeople, and we were more focused on having conversations about the science and business problems. At events run by Bullpen and several other organizations we were able to meet with decision makers, founders, and investors that gave great insights we'll be taking home with us, and will ideally lead to partnerships and deals in the coming weeks. 

üí∞ Commercialization is king. The founders and CXOs we met all had amazing scientific and technological innovations at the core of their companies, but the problems everyone was looking to solve were around money and market. How do you fund the science? How do you get it in the hands and bodies of users? How can we make the business growth align with the mission? When you're learning to be a scientist most of the emphasis is on the hard scientific problems, but once you step into the business of science, it's all about engineering human systems. 

ü§ù The best way to form relationships is in person. Ontologic was founded post-pandemic, and as a software company, most of our work can be done remotely. But when you're limited to a 1h virtual panel or a 30m zoom meeting you don't make the same personal connection that you do in person. I was so happy to run into friends coincidentally on the conference floor and have conversations I likely wouldn't have purposely sought out with people I just happened to meet at satellite events. It strengthens relationships in a very human way that isn't captured in a virtual setting, and I plan to make time for in-person social events as much as possible moving forward. 

Would love to hear others' takeaways! Ontologic 524 followers 9mo Our leadership team had such an amazing time at #BIO2024 !

We need to tell this new success story and outline the needs in responding to this emerging growing economy. 

Indigenomics is an economic platform to connect to the GDP, identify targets, create collective actions that support wealth generation within our communities. $100 billion Indigenous economy - that is the number we need to be paying attention to."" - Clint Davis Indigenomics invites dialogue, and thought provoking insight into the possibility of the Indigenous relationship both in Canada and beyond. It explores the pathway of the threshold of the Indigenous relationship and modern economies.

Had the opportunity to connect with lots of colleagues while proudly representing Tlicho Investment Corporation & Group of Companies with members of the team and Tlicho leadership. 

Several of us sat down on a panel discussing a decarbonized mining world. Some great examples from across the North for both active and exploration mining project all of which had significant Indigenous involvement. 

It was announced that I have joined the board for Kingfisher Metals Corp. Excited to join Dustin Perry, P.Geo. and the team in their journey to develop the next world class properties in the golden triangle.  They have a great vision and are focused on creating value for the Tahltan nation on the lands that they operate on. 

Hope everyone had an excellent PDAC as well!!! #mining #exploration #indigenousbusiness #indigenomics #esg #community #criticalminerals #nwt #yellowknife 97 3 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Elizabeth Fillatre Miller Vice President Environment and Social Responsibility (ESR) at Seabridge Gold Inc. 2w Report this comment Was great to see you Paul!

Some of the key points included:

- The co-management of mining within the NWT between Indigenous groups, government and industry. 

- The best practices of socio-economic agreements and Impact Benefit Agreements that have resulted in meaningful employment, capacity building, economic opportunity and infrastructure. 

- The planned reclamation of the mines before they are even started ensuring that there isn‚Äôt a negative legacy at the end of mine life. 

- How the mining sector has impacted Indigenous communities both positively and negatively. 

- The eye watering experiences of Lily James and her team experiencing -50 for the first time (full disclosure it‚Äôs still darn cold for us northerners as well. 

Thank you for the invite to participate Natural Diamond Council and to Raluca Anghel for organizing.

Flow-through shares have helped build Canada‚Äôs mining and energy industries for decades. It‚Äôs time to give our digital economy the same chance.

Botanical Products & Gift Boxes 1y Report this post PEER MENTORING IN BUSINESS!

I've had the honor of learning from very strong and successful women and men in business!  

It didn't take me long to realize that I could not and should not attempt to manage, operate or grow my business on my own!  I needed to learn from the business women and men who had done this before me!  I learned very quickly that we were not in competition, and so many successful business people were willing to help me grow my business!

I learned from several business books published by successful business women and I shamelessly support the writings and teachings from  Arlene Dickinson, Venture Communications.  I had chats with the successful beauty brand #Cheekbone creator, Jen Harper, and successful female leaders from #indigenomics , Carol Anne Hilton; #yukonsoaps , #RavenReads , #Indigenousbox , #BearsLairTV creator Geena Jackson and so many more peer mentors and successful business people across Canada.  I am so grateful!!

I also have a business coach who helps me  to  find resources for the growth  and management of my business.  

I encourage everyone to find their peer mentors in business! #peers #businessmentors #businessincanada #businessmanagement #businessbooks #businesssuccess 7 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 1,129 followers 832 Posts 1 Article View Profile Connect More from this author Big News!

Entrepreneur, Author x 2, Speaker, Advisor. Advancing #IndigenousEconomy & IndigenomicsAI #indigenousAI 5mo Report this post #indigenomics Olthuis, Kleer, Townshend LLP 1,389 followers 5mo In our latest blog post 'Good corporate governance must take into account Aboriginal rights,' authors Nick Kennedy , Jaclyn McNamara and Thadsha Chandrakumaran highlight the Supreme Court's recent refusal to hear the appeal in¬†Thomas v Rio Tinto Alcan Inc, 2024 BCCA 62 [Saik‚Äôuz]. In¬†Saik‚Äôuz, the British Columbia Court of Appeal found that Aboriginal fishing rights were capable of grounding a claim in nuisance against a private entity, but that Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (‚ÄúRio Tinto‚Äù) had a complete defence because its actions were authorized by statute.

The Supreme Court‚Äôs refusal to hear this appeal was a missed opportunity to advance reconciliation. The Court could have done so by abolishing the statutory authorization defence for infringements of Aboriginal rights and title, thereby allocating a greater share of the risk of liability onto private entities. If the Supreme Court had taken this bold step, it would have increased the likelihood of these claims being settled, either by the private entities themselves or by the Crown under pressure from the private sector.

With a cut-off grade of 2.2%, the project will be able to process nearly all the resource, extracting maximum value from the four critical rare earths in the basket ‚Äîneodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium‚Äîused in consumer electronics, #electricvehicles , and #windturbines , in addition to other recoverable REEs which may hold future value: samarium, europium, gadolinium, lanthanum and cerium.

Even in a lower pricing environment, the Rainbow holds a competitive advantage as a low-cost producer, given the nature of the asset.

This research journal promises to be an enlightening exploration of the complex intersection of culture, environment, and economic change, which is so often overlooked in discussions surrounding oil exploration.
The Urhobo people's heritage and history, deeply entwined with their ancestral lands, set a powerful backdrop for the narrative of transformation brought about by the discovery and exploitation of oil. Your work sheds light on how such seismic changes affect not only the environment but also the social fabric, cultural identity, and livelihoods of the community.
The title ""Roots and Shifts: The Urhobo People and the Coming of Oil"" poignantly captures the essence of this transformation ‚Äî the roots representing the cultural and environmental richness of the community, while the shifts signify the profound disruptions and challenges brought by the arrival of the oil industry.
Your approach to chronicling this history is invaluable, and I look forward to diving deeper into how these changes have reshaped the lives of the Urhobo people. It is crucial to explore such topics from a local, grassroots perspective to create a more holistic understanding of the effects of resource extraction on indigenous communities. This journal will no doubt foster greater dialogue around responsible resource management and community engagement.
I eagerly await the next installment of this series, and I commend your commitment to highlighting the voices of those who are often left out of mainstream discussions about oil and development. #OilImpact #CulturalHeritage #EnvironmentalChange #CommunityResearch #IndigenousRights #SustainableDevelopment #BlackGold Ogheneruemu Siemuri Graduate || Environmentalist || Ex- Intern at Tudaka Analytical Limited || Editor || Teacher || Fashion Designer|| Baker || Ecowriter ||Student at Delta State University, Nigeria 2mo Edited üì¢ New Research Journal Alert!

If we break down the terms, then Makar means Capricorn and
Sankranti means enty of the sun. Hence Makar Sankrati simply means entry of the sun into the zodiac sign of Capricorn. This is the day when the sun begins its northward journey in the sky, from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of cancer.
 This celestial event has a profound effect on the biosphere and the
environment, due to the changes in the Earth's energy dynamics. 
This shift results in longer days, higher temperatures, and a boost in
photosynthesis, which supports plant growth and enhances
agricultural cycles. It also influences animal behavior, triggering migration patterns in birds and awakening hibernating species. The warming effect
accelerates biological activity across ecosystems, from forests to
grasslands.
Beyond ecological impacts, the increase in sunlight benefits human
well-being by enhancing mood and energy levels, contributing to
social and cultural celebrations like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu and Lohri.
One festival, so many names !
Makar Sankranti will begin on 14 th January at 9.03 AM IST.
Greetings and best wishes for the auspicious festival. #MakarSankranti #CapricornSun #SolarJourney #WinterSolstice #EnergyShift #BiosphereImpact #EcologicalChange #LongerDays #AgricultureCycle #PhotosynthesisBoost #NatureAwakening #MigrationPatterns #HumanWellBeing #CulturalCelebrations #FestivalsOfIndia #Pongal #Bihu #FestivalSeason #NewBeginnings #SolarEvent #MakarSankranti2025 #AuspiciousOccasions #GoodVibes ‚Ä¶more Makar Sankranti: The Scientific basis https://www.youtube.com/ 19 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Dr Angela C Meyers Author, Coach, Consultant. Reducing Human Suffering. Enhancing Human Thriving. 3mo Edited Report this post Last month, I hosted an international Polymath Retreat in Corfu, Greece with brilliant minds from Canada, the USA, Brazil, England, Switzerland, and the Netherlands‚Äîa true global gathering. 

We had a diverse, well-balanced group, with roughly half male and half female participants. 

Our mission was bold: to begin tackling some of the world‚Äôs most pressing global issues.

Did we figure out how to save the world in a three-hour workshop? No. But did we start an important conversation and document our insights? Absolutely. And will we build from this foundation? Without question. 

This is just the beginning, but it‚Äôs a necessary start.

Humanity must self-organize differently if we are to solve the polycrisis on a global scale. 

Who can rise to the challenge? Polymaths‚Äîthe systems thinkers, the big-picture problem solvers. 

Let‚Äôs support the right polymaths to help save humanity, because they just might be the ones who can. #Polymathy #GlobalSolutions #PolymathPower #SolveTheCrisis #TeamHumanity 15 2 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 4,887 followers View Profile Connect Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

Murphy Indigenomics 1w Report this comment After a few days to process and reflect, I am even more grateful to have attended RES this year. ‚ú®Ô∏è

I first attended RES as a student, and it was transformative. Then, I hustled to secure travel grants each year because my degree programs lacked the voices and stories of tribal communities in economic development and social work. RES filled that gap.ü§ì

This year, I had the honor of meeting around 15 first-time attendees‚Äîthanking them for coming like I was part of NCAIED. I was genuinely proud to meet them and excited for the connections they will build among 4,600+ attendees.üòÑ

RES isn‚Äôt just a conference‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful force, bringing Indigenous professionals, entrepreneurs, and leaders together to create something bigger than ourselves. ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è Like Reply 1¬†Reaction 2¬†Reactions Dana Wells-Durocher Indigenous Community Engagement & Collaboration 2d Report this comment Such a great opportunity, I still have yet to make it there lol üòÜ Like Reply 1¬†Reaction See more comments To view or add a comment, sign in 1,200 followers 411 Posts View Profile Connect Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

The Indigenomics Institute Scholarship was established to honour the resilience of Indigenous people who were systematically denied a seat at the economic table of this country.
The scholarship goes to Indigenous students enrolled in Business, Commerce or Finance academic programs across Canada in either Bachelor or Masters Programs.
Proceeds from revenues from the Indigenomics Store, comprised of t-shirts, mugs, candles, jewelry and tea and other products will go towards the distribution of annual Indigenomics scholarships.
This is the 5th scholarship that has been awarded since 2022 and the Indigenomics Institute is pleased to welcome Vancity as a partner to the Indigenomics Scholarship. #Indigenomics #indigenouseconomy #100billion 23 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Gil Yaron Managing Director, Circular Innovation 1y Report this comment Way to go Caleb Maurice !!!

We kept it short and punchy focussing on:

- The TNDC journey which requires a strong team, supportive community and industry /government support. 

- A drive towards a decarbonzed mining jurisdiction which will be the first Tier 1 carbon neutral mining jurisdiction in Canada.

- The need for Government and Industry to continue investing in Indigenous communities and businesses and the areas they reside in. Indigenous communities are often the gatekeepers for projects to move forward. Bring Indigenous communities into the opportunities in a meaningful way as true partners. 

Thank you again for Tahltan Nation Development Corporation (TNDC) to present.

Advancing #IndigenousEconomy & IndigenomicsAI #indigenousAI 1y Report this post Indigenomics NOW draws inspiration from the powerful Nuu-chah-nulth concept of ‚Äútsawalk,"" which translates to ""one."" This profound principle reminds us that all living beings, from humans and animals to the very plants that sustain us, are fundamentally interconnected, forming a single, harmonious whole.

Within the framework of Indigenomics, ""tsawalk"" becomes a guiding light, to acknowledge the intrinsic interconnectedness of our economic systems with the natural world. Indigenomics NOW is designed to reflect the natural world and serves to advance an economic narrative that is shaped by the natural world.

Indigenomics NOW serves as a powerful platform to translate this philosophy into action. November 14th ,2024. Registration opens soon.

Ontario's energy project growth is happening at a pace we have never seen, and First Nations like MSIFN are at the epicenter. Moderator Matt McClearn from the Globe and Mail's Energy, Natural Resources and Environment Team focused on the challenges and solutions for the energy transition, including the rapid growth of First Nation investments and co-development of significant projects. I am proud of our work at MSIFN through Minogi to accelerate clean energy investments with our First Nation and private sector partners with new and creative investment solutions.

We had an informative discussion with co-panelists Jason Rioux , Chief Development Officer of NRStor Inc. , and Simmer Anand , Senior Manager, Indigenous Relations¬†of Hydro One .

By swapping out their old engines for the cutting-edge Waukesha VHP Series Five engines from INNIO. These engines not only reduce methane emissions by 90% but also cut CO2e intensity by 20%! üå±üí®

The best part? Enstor didn't have to choose between profitability and sustainability. The reUp program allowed them to upgrade to the latest tech while reusing existing infrastructure, making it a win-win for both the environment and their bottom line. üí°üí∞

This project is a shining example of how innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand. Kudos to Enstor for leading the way! üëè #WaukeshaEngines #EnergyInnovation #SustainableSolutions #CarbonNeutral #OilAndGas #ClimateAction üåçüîãüí°

A little technical, but I wholeheartedly recommend for anyone investing in nodal markets. 

The Aurora Energy Research team‚Äôs development of capabilities for flow-based nodal analysis provides an important example of ‚Äúuseful complexity‚Äù in power modelling.

George Box famously said: ‚Äúall models are wrong, but some are useful‚Äù.

As a modelling company first and foremost, perhaps the most important (and often hardest) strategic decision for Aurora is deciding how much complexity to incorporate into our models.

Complexity in models is expensive: it increases solve time and compute; and takes time and deep expertise to code and debug. 

For many years and in many markets, Aurora have explored various ways to model nodal pricing in power markets (e.g. extrapolation based on history; structural statistical relationships) but none of them provide the flexibility and richness of Fundamental Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) modelling. 

A really great explanation here of why we go to the effort to do it, and why it is so important for anyone investing in nodal markets.

As TEVERRA continues to expand in the CCS market, it‚Äôs inspiring to see #Georgia stepping up with incredible opportunities to decarbonize industries using CCS technologies. As an #Atlanta -based company, we are thrilled to play a significant role in advancing this #cleanenergy movement. #TEVERRA closed 2024 on a high note with significant #DOE funding to advance CCS initiatives in Georgia, and we‚Äôve started 2025 strong, being selected by a state government to review Class VI well applications. These milestones complement the multimillion-dollar funding we‚Äôve received from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) since 2019 to make real-time #CO2 plume monitoring a reality through our #CompressDeck , #FluidTrack , and #GeoDeck technologies.

I‚Äôm looking forward to engaging with industry leaders, sharing insights, and exploring ways we can collectively drive #innovation in CCS.

In an era where innovation is the cornerstone of progress, the conversation around decentralized science (DeSci) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in longevity biotech is timely and vital. 

The recent Longevity+DeSci Summit in NYC, hosted by Lifespan.io , was a pivotal event that presented a fascinating panel discussion on the intersection of decentralized science (DeSci) and autonomous organizations in longevity biotech. 

The summit featured an impressive lineup of panelists. These thought leaders each brought a unique perspective and expertise, contributing to our understanding of how DeSci and DAOs can revolutionize our engagement with longevity biotech. The synergy between traditional biotech and emerging decentralized frameworks will pave the way for unprecedented breakthroughs. 

As leaders and innovators, it's crucial that we stay ahead of these conversations and actively leverage them to foster growth and collaboration in the biotech sphere. I highly recommend watching the entire discussion for insights into the future of longevity and how we can collectively push the boundaries of science and technology.

Reminding people that animal trials showed no increase in respiration despite taking out blood.  There's a reason why we can only donate 1 pint of blood because if you took out more the heart would have to pump harder to get same amount oxygen to the parts of the body with less blood volume.  That means you have to circulate a lower volume of blood more times to keep the same output.  Since respiration didn't increase its reasonable to conclude that the animals got oxygen from the molecule.

With a cut-off grade of 2.2%, the project will be able to process nearly all the resource, extracting maximum value from the four critical rare earths in the basket ‚Äîneodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium‚Äîused in consumer electronics, #electricvehicles , and #windturbines , in addition to other recoverable REEs which may hold future value: samarium, europium, gadolinium, lanthanum and cerium.

Even in a lower pricing environment, the Rainbow holds a competitive advantage as a low-cost producer, given the nature of the asset. Rainbow will release a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) by early 2025, with a preliminary update expected in November 2024. These milestones will offer further insights into the project's #profitability and #valuepotential .

This research journal promises to be an enlightening exploration of the complex intersection of culture, environment, and economic change, which is so often overlooked in discussions surrounding oil exploration.
The Urhobo people's heritage and history, deeply entwined with their ancestral lands, set a powerful backdrop for the narrative of transformation brought about by the discovery and exploitation of oil. Your work sheds light on how such seismic changes affect not only the environment but also the social fabric, cultural identity, and livelihoods of the community.
The title ""Roots and Shifts: The Urhobo People and the Coming of Oil"" poignantly captures the essence of this transformation ‚Äî the roots representing the cultural and environmental richness of the community, while the shifts signify the profound disruptions and challenges brought by the arrival of the oil industry.
Your approach to chronicling this history is invaluable, and I look forward to diving deeper into how these changes have reshaped the lives of the Urhobo people. It is crucial to explore such topics from a local, grassroots perspective to create a more holistic understanding of the effects of resource extraction on indigenous communities. This journal will no doubt foster greater dialogue around responsible resource management and community engagement.
I eagerly await the next installment of this series, and I commend your commitment to highlighting the voices of those who are often left out of mainstream discussions about oil and development. #OilImpact #CulturalHeritage #EnvironmentalChange #CommunityResearch #IndigenousRights #SustainableDevelopment #BlackGold Ogheneruemu Siemuri Graduate || Environmentalist || Ex- Intern at Tudaka Analytical Limited || Editor || Teacher || Fashion Designer|| Baker || Ecowriter ||Student at Delta State University, Nigeria 2mo Edited üì¢ New Research Journal Alert!

If we break down the terms, then Makar means Capricorn and
Sankranti means enty of the sun. Hence Makar Sankrati simply means entry of the sun into the zodiac sign of Capricorn. This is the day when the sun begins its northward journey in the sky, from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of cancer.
 This celestial event has a profound effect on the biosphere and the
environment, due to the changes in the Earth's energy dynamics. 
This shift results in longer days, higher temperatures, and a boost in
photosynthesis, which supports plant growth and enhances
agricultural cycles. It also influences animal behavior, triggering migration patterns in birds and awakening hibernating species. The warming effect
accelerates biological activity across ecosystems, from forests to
grasslands.
Beyond ecological impacts, the increase in sunlight benefits human
well-being by enhancing mood and energy levels, contributing to
social and cultural celebrations like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu and Lohri.
One festival, so many names !
Makar Sankranti will begin on 14 th January at 9.03 AM IST.
Greetings and best wishes for the auspicious festival. #MakarSankranti #CapricornSun #SolarJourney #WinterSolstice #EnergyShift #BiosphereImpact #EcologicalChange #LongerDays #AgricultureCycle #PhotosynthesisBoost #NatureAwakening #MigrationPatterns #HumanWellBeing #CulturalCelebrations #FestivalsOfIndia #Pongal #Bihu #FestivalSeason #NewBeginnings #SolarEvent #MakarSankranti2025 #AuspiciousOccasions #GoodVibes ‚Ä¶more Makar Sankranti: The Scientific basis https://www.youtube.com/ 19 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Dr Angela C Meyers Author, Coach, Consultant. Reducing Human Suffering.

We had a diverse, well-balanced group, with roughly half male and half female participants. 

Our mission was bold: to begin tackling some of the world‚Äôs most pressing global issues.

Did we figure out how to save the world in a three-hour workshop? No. But did we start an important conversation and document our insights? Absolutely. And will we build from this foundation? Without question. 

This is just the beginning, but it‚Äôs a necessary start.

Humanity must self-organize differently if we are to solve the polycrisis on a global scale. 

Who can rise to the challenge? Polymaths‚Äîthe systems thinkers, the big-picture problem solvers. 

Let‚Äôs support the right polymaths to help save humanity, because they just might be the ones who can. #Polymathy #GlobalSolutions #PolymathPower #SolveTheCrisis #TeamHumanity 15 2 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 570 followers 52 Posts View Profile Follow Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

The #Indigenomics by Design conference has served to inspire, educate, and humble me. The thought leaders, change agents, and community builders that have presented and participated in the event have made clear what #indigenouspower is and the impact of that power and success.

Some sources of inspiration (and this is not at all comprehensive so I encourage future attendance at the event!) include:

üîãIndigenous People‚Äôs are leading the clean energy transition. 
‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ÄùIndigenous inclusion means a just transition to a clean energy future.‚Äù ~ Carol Anne Hilton, MBA ‚ñ´Ô∏è Research from a 2020 Indigenous Clean Energy Social Enterprise report identified 197  Canadian companies in the clean energy sector.
‚ñ´Ô∏è Research from Chris Henderson was cited, noting ‚ÄúIndigenous communities are the third largest owners of clean energy companies in Canada.‚Äù

üß≠ The theory of change must chart the straightest line between the current and future state. This must involve meaningful and deep consideration of what economic reconciliation means and a commitment and plan to advance it. Without this understanding, there is a risk of advancing projects merely for marketing purposes, missing true impact.

ü§ù Partnerships are key to advancing economic development and building indigenous prosperity.

Further reflections of the learnings of today and yesterday are required. Deepest gratitude to all in the room and event organizers for creating this space and opportunity. 25 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Karen Lamare 1y Report this comment Thanks for sharing!

My ""why"" is simple: I believe in the power of empowered founders and businesses to change the world.
That's why I'm passionate about both REV Global and ayana Foundation Here's how they fit into the bigger picture:
* REV Global:¬†At REV Global, we equip businesses with the tools and resources they need to¬†thrive. Stronger businesses create more jobs, drive innovation, and fuel economic growth. This creates a ripple effect of positive change.
* Ayana Foundation:¬†The Ayana Foundation fosters a supportive community where founders can connect, share experiences, and learn from each other.¬†Empowering¬†and¬†uplifting¬†these individuals is key to their success, which translates into a wider impact on the world.
Together, REV Global and ayana Foundation create a powerful ecosystem for impact. One provides the tools, the other fosters the connections. Both are necessary to empower founders and businesses to reach their full potential and drive positive change.

It's a once a year ask. Our goal is $5000 üôèü§û https://lnkd.in/dhvTUR6M I've been a non exec board member and adviser to Women In Research (WIRe) for 8 years, and committing to another two year term as well as donating, here's why:

üëÄ In the last 8 years it's been about getting women from ""she's sweet"" to the C-Suite. Seeing really is believing. 

üë≠Amazing things happen when people with a shared vision and values come together at this small and mighty not-for-profit. 

üìà Growth, nearly 30k #members . It's free for individuals to plug into the benefits, funded by companies and individuals investing in women in research. 

üå± Education to #upskill women in #MRX . From soft power, influence, and business and finance saviness. Hundreds of women took the #accelerate program through covid and the new to industry mini course. 

ü§ù 1000s of new alliances have been made through the WIRe #mentorship program. Many of them very senior connections that provide wisdom and open doors. 

üêù Hive minds, faster than #chatgpt abound to help find the right people to connect with. Especially for the tricky things that are best left unrecorded. 

üåè Mobility, people are finding unlooked for opportunities, connections, introductions career changes, skills, new techniques and most of all friendships. 

And yes.... Women have also been coached by other women and men into the C-suite, you know who you are, result!! üèÅ

ü§ç  The beaming faces full of possibility are priceless for the women in developing countries who've been sponsored by WIRe in #scholarships to study #MarketResearch Hundreds of senior dedicated businesses leaders, both men and women invest in women's success in the #insights industry through WIRe. 

I personally help numerous people all over the world move into #mediaresearch , #data and #Insights roles. 

2025 plans? 
We focus on what the community prioritises. #inclusivity starts with speaking up on the 2028 focus.

The conference was FNMPC‚Äôs biggest event by far, with over 1500 delegates, 200+ companies and over 450 Indigenous representatives. 

The main theme was showcasing how companies that honour and incorporate Indigenous consent across their business and supply chains hold a collective advantage over those who do not. 

Key topics including the unveiling of the National Indigenous Electrification Strategy, Free, Prior and Informed Consent, Canadian Mining and First Nations, and Indigenous Women in Finance.

¬†
In this direction, Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), the flagship legislative initiative to ensure EU‚Äôs secure and sustainable supply of #criticalrawmaterials , creates a remarkable opportunity for #Greece , one of the most well-endowed mineral European countries, to exploit its mineral wealth in a #sustainable way.

We are giving shape to a core element of the UNSG Panel on Critical Minerals!

This panel‚Äôs recent report proposes the creation of a High-Level Advisory Group to promote ""fair benefit-sharing, meaningful value addition, & economic diversification in low- & middle-income (LMIC) producer countries. 

To be really meaningful, this Group must:

‚úÖ Confront deep-seated global power imbalances in trade relations. Free trade has become a huge barrier to LMIC‚Äôs development, locking them into exporting raw material. The system needs to change to deliver shared value & economic equity.

‚úÖ Look at ""value-addition"" in every sense. It needs to include transformation of minerals in higher levels of the value chain, particularly in clean energy technologies!

‚úÖ Promote collaboration between Southern countries over competition, to build cross-regional value chains. 

‚úÖ Finally, who‚Äôs in the Advisory group really matters to break the status quo. It must include bold voices from CSOs, Indigenous Peoples and government representatives of both consumer and producer countries - especially those challenging global inequalities and trade frameworks.

We must ensure that the Advisory group starts on solid grounds and doesn't overlook these priorities. PWYP and partners are committed to making it happen!

Finally the controlled , archaic, closed economy is dwindling and being built by the people‚Äôs who haven‚Äôt been bothered and perhaps inspired by drudgery and have kept moving ahead.  When the hurdle rate is achieved or surpassed then at that time exponential growth becomes imminent.  Still too far away from it, however, in 5 years the gap will be much narrower not because of colonial incentives but by the energy, imagination, determination of the people‚Äôs.

Last Friday, I had the incredible honor of earning my Doctorate of Economic Development from New Mexico State University, becoming the first Native American to receive this degree.

This journey has been one of perseverance, passion, and purpose. My doctoral work focused on Navajo entrepreneurship and economic development‚Äîcritical areas that guide my efforts to create sustainable growth and opportunities for the Navajo Nation and other Indigenous communities.

I am deeply grateful for the support of my family, mentors. I am also grateful for my colleagues, and the organizations that have championed the work toward strengthening tribal economic development along the way.

As I look to the future, I am inspired to continue advancing tribal economic development, advocating for data sovereignty, and creating pathways that uplift our communities.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey‚Äîthis is just the beginning! #Doctorate #EconomicDevelopment #NavajoNation #IndigenousLeadership #DataSovereignty #EducationForChange #Indigenomics 83 5 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Ron Norman Director of Pacific Rim Chiropractic Inc.

üåç Their work underscores a fundamental truth: inclusive institutions‚Äîthose that serve the broader population rather than the interests of a select few‚Äîare crucial for sustained economic growth and development. Their research helps explain why some countries prosper while others struggle, despite similar natural resources or historical circumstances.

When European colonization reshaped much of the world, the type of institutions introduced played a pivotal role in determining future prosperity. Nations with inclusive political and economic systems often experienced long-term success, while those with extractive institutions‚Äîdesigned to benefit elites at the expense of the population‚Äîsaw stagnation and decline.
The laureates also highlight why institutional reform is often difficult: those in power prefer short-term gains and control, while inclusive changes offer long-term benefits for society. In times of political unrest or revolution, however, the path to democracy and inclusive institutions becomes a possibility.

This research is critical in addressing one of our time's greatest challenges‚Äîreducing global income inequality. Their findings provide essential insights into how better governance and institutional reforms can pave the way for more equitable, sustainable development.

After #MIT , the #HAW and the #ESSSR have chosen the #PXLUniversity in #Hasselt My article titled ""Environmental destructions: a macroeconomic approach leaded by anthropology"" will detail how modern macroeconomy is the resultant of a huge clash between geopolitical, strategical, psychological and social reasons. The upcoming multipolar world will be more than never the theater of states competition where exploring new lands is crucial for food, tools, energies, living places, factories, mines, transports, tourism, military or technical tests. Most of these aspects has direct and indirect impacts on natural areas. This predation-dependence duality defined by a permanent need for supplies of societies is not conductive for a sustainable economy. Until now, the context was torn by a certain opposition between fierce conservatism and an excessive quest for profit.

A closer look at the whole operatory chain from several examples can lead us to understand all the processes which lead countries, consumers and even native people to consent to destroy natural areas yet necessary for interspecies coevolution. This unviable situation can be solved by a better understanding of each mechanism often caused by a lack of global dialogue and diverging interests.

It is also a proposition for some diagnostics in line with the #UnitedNations #SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) which can be applied to different scales (local, national and international). All indicate several solutions residing on symbiotic economy, innovation, salary guarantee, transdisciplinary dialogue, diplomacy, interconnection between areas and global cooperation between universities, compagnies, government and civil society. From there, future perspectives will emerge.

Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson have been awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics for their pioneering work on how political and economic institutions shape national prosperity. They have shown how inclusive institutions, such as democratic governance and free markets, promote long-term economic growth by providing access to opportunities for all. Conversely, extractive institutions, which are designed to benefit a small elite (often seen in dictatorships or monopolistic economies), hinder development by limiting the majority‚Äôs access to resources.

Their influential book, Why Nations Fail, provides examples such as:

	‚Ä¢	North vs. South Korea: Despite having the same cultural and historical roots, North Korea‚Äôs extractive institutions have led to poverty, while South Korea‚Äôs inclusive institutions have driven economic success.

	‚Ä¢	Colonial Latin America vs. Colonial North America: The Spanish colonizers implemented extractive systems in Latin America, focusing on resource extraction, whereas settlers in North America established more inclusive institutions, fostering long-term prosperity.

This research explains why some countries thrive and others lag behind, offering vital insights into reducing global inequality. #NobelPrize #Economics #WealthInequality #InstitutionalEconomics #InclusiveGrowth #GlobalDevelopment #DaronAcemoglu #SimonJohnson #JamesRobinson Sources: NobelPrize.org , Business Insider 27 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Kadir Tas CEO @ KTMC AGENCY | Finance Management 5mo Edited Report this post Congratulations to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson on winning the 2024 The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences!

U.S.-based economists Daron Acemoglu (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Simon Johnson (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and James Robinson (University of Chicago) have been awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Their prize-winning work, ‚ÄúInstitutions as the Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth,‚Äù explores how economic and political institutions shape the development and #prosperity of nations. They argue that inclusive institutions, which allow broad participation in economic and political life, lead to sustained economic growth. In contrast, extractive institutions, which concentrate power and #wealth , hinder development and perpetuate #inequality . This research has had a profound impact on how we understand global disparities in wealth and development. ‚Ä¶more Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in The Zambakari Advisory, L.L.C. 112 followers 5mo Report this post The 2024 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson for their groundbreaking research on the role of institutions in shaping economic prosperity. Their work, particularly focusing on the colonial past, demonstrates how the establishment of inclusive institutions‚Äîprotecting property rights and allowing for broad economic participation‚Äîleads to long-term prosperity. In contrast, countries with extractive institutions, designed to enrich elites at the expense of the broader population, experience short-term gains but long-term stagnation. 

Their research, which highlights the institutional roots of inequality, has influenced economic and political thought worldwide. While their findings favor democratic institutions for sustainable growth, they also acknowledge that authoritarian regimes can achieve short-term economic success, though at the cost of instability and innovation. Their work is particularly impactful in understanding global inequality and the persistence of economic gaps between nations, with a focus on how colonial history shapes modern economies. https://lnkd.in/gjeNZrwH #EconomicNobel #InstitutionalEconomics #GlobalInequality Three Receive Nobel in Economics for Research on Global Inequality https://www.nytimes.com Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in CNR-IRISS Istituto di Ricerca su Innovazione e Servizi per lo Sviluppo 1,525 followers 4mo Edited Report this post üìåStarting tomorrow the Conference ""The Future of Hope: an interdisciplinary dialogue""

‚ÄúMining to me is a journey back to my roots. Growing up with parents who were miners instilled in me a curiosity about the industry from an early age. Following this path was a natural inclination, and I'm grateful I did.
In this journey, I've delved deeper into the world of rocks and minerals than I ever imagined. I've forged friendships that I know will endure a lifetime. Witnessing mentorship within the crews, regardless of age differences, has been truly inspiring. It's a testament to the power of training and the willingness to learn from one another.
I firmly believe that collective involvement in training and mentorship can transform the mining industry into a safer and more fulfilling environment for all. Being certified isn't just a badge of achievement; it's a reminder of the expertise I've gained and the responsibility I carry as a professional in my field.‚Äù

These past two years have been an incredible ride filled with challenges, victories, and invaluable lessons. Each hurdle I faced and triumph I celebrated has played a crucial role in shaping the person I am today. From navigating the complexities of mining to collaborating with amazing teams, every experience has been a cherished lesson in resilience, adaptability, and continuous learning.

I am thankful to SROL ( Thor Explorations Ltd ) for providing me with opportunities for growth and development. Every day with SROL has been a chance to push my boundaries, embrace new challenges, and grow both personally and professionally.

None of this would have been possible without the unwavering support of mentors, managers, and colleagues who have been there to guide and inspire me every step of the way. I am profoundly grateful to everyone who believed in me and helped me soar to new heights.

Looking forward, I'm brimming with excitement for the adventures that lie ahead. Each day, I'm driven to make a meaningful impact in the mining industry and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future for generations to come. There's still so much to learn, explore, and achieve, and I can't wait to dive in headfirst.

Here's to two years of growth, gratitude, and endless possibilities! üöÄ #WorkAnniversary #GeotechnicalEngineering #MiningIndustry #Gratitude 988 90 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 29,154 followers 996 Posts View Profile Connect Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

The event brought together 20 visionary leaders from academia, business, civil society, government, and indigenous communities to advance global solutions that can help truly value nature in our economy.
¬†
While there has been significant progress in environmental-economic accounting over the past two decades, many approaches still face challenges in gaining traction due to socio-economic and political barriers. These challenges hinder widespread adoption of strategies that place nature on an equal footing with financial capital.
¬†
In this context, the convening aimed to challenge traditional growth paradigms, propose a bold vision for mainstreaming natural capital in decision-making, and identify actionable solutions for policy, data, and finance.
¬†
Swapan‚Äôs involvement in this critical dialogue reinforces IORA‚Äôs commitment to driving impactful change and innovation in the pursuit of a world where economic development goes hand-in-hand with environmental stewardship.
¬†
The event was a powerful reminder that while we have made significant strides, there‚Äôs still much to be done to ensure that the value of our natural resources is truly reflected in economic decisions. #NaturalCapital #Sustainability #Leadership #Innovation #TeamIORA 39 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in SORA 314 followers 4mo Report this post üéôÔ∏è On Stage Now!

It has been a delight to work with these three, to engage in truthful and curious conversations, and have their support in advancing economic reconciliation. Much gratitude to each of you for how you show up!

Last night I read TELUS' recently released 2023 Indigenous Reconciliation and Connectivity Report and I would encourage folks to do the same. https://lnkd.in/g3Yuk7xm I encourage folks to read it for three reasons. The first reason is we, non-Indigenous folks, are grossly overdue on our collective duty to be responding to truth and reconciliation. The second reason is because I have experience both working in telecommunications and leading the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business Progressive Aboriginal Relations program and I know just how much persistent, intentional effort is required to prioritize reconciliation and shift behaviours inside both giant and small working environments as the barriers to allow change to transpire can and do run deep within each of us as individuals, as a collective and in the colonial system we exist within. 

The third reason is when I read this report I can see that TELUS is both acknowledging they have learning to do AND that they are implementing their learnings from the Indigenous voices they are learning from. This is what reconciliation looks like my friends. 

It looks like Johnny Kelto III being the first voice we hear from followed by acknowledgments of the obligation and responsibility that we non-Indigenous folks/businesses have to ensure there is no longer misappropriation of Indigenous art/artists. 

It looks like bringing our responsibility to be responding to TRC Call to Action 92 to life through prioritized actions that are progressing, not just words in polished corporate copy on websites. 

Give the Indigenous Reconciliation and Connectivity Report a read and invite curiosity in to ask where reconciliation is at with your company/business/self and what will your company/business/self start shifting to ensure you are progressing in persistent, intentional reconcili-ACTION?

No matter how big or small our places of work are reconciliation is required, and it is not difficult. The difficulty, is a barrier that stems from the discomfort of being responsible to acknowledge difficult truths. We must have truth centered in order for reconciliation to happen. So let's get truthful. #Reconciliation #TELUS 27 3 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Stephanie Han Senior Program Manager at TELUS 1y Report this comment It's a privilege to be on this journey with you, Jen!

Last week, our studio was injected with youthful energy and inspiring dialogue when the incredible team from Praxium & Crater joined us. Through playful games and deep conversations, we discovered remarkable synergies in our approach to design as a catalyst for positive impact. We were inspired by how their team is empowering the next generation and driving change through design.

These moments of connection remind us that design is more than the outcomes, it's a collaborative journey of imagination, empathy, and our collective potential.¬†Thank you Louis Puah Carol Lim Marion Ng and the team for coming by! 10 2 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Natallia Drachicova Where expertise meets dedication | Senior Business Relationship & Partnership Manager @Modsen 6mo Report this post ‚ÄúùëªùíâùíÜ ùíÇùíìùíï ùíÑùíâùíÇùíçùíçùíÜùíèùíàùíÜùíî ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíïùíÜùíÑùíâùíèùíêùíçùíêùíàùíö, ùíÇùíèùíÖ ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíïùíÜùíÑùíâùíèùíêùíçùíêùíàùíö ùíäùíèùíîùíëùíäùíìùíÜùíî ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíÇùíìùíï.‚Äù - John Lasseter¬†

-In the way we work.¬†
-In the way we communicate.¬†
- Even in the way we have a certain type of coffee on a break.¬†

Nowadays, Gen Z professionals have been a focal point in several industries. Maybe it‚Äôs the thought of them being too radical, emotional, and passionate about a lot of things. While these three adjectives may imply youthful angst, they can be used as powerful tools to empower a company‚Äôs success. It is through being radical, emotional, and passion that we learn to challenge industry norms.

And it is in overcoming and learning through those challenges that we learn to truly grow. 2025 will be a year of broken boundaries (in a good way). Another year is on its way and it‚Äôs ours, everyone‚Äôs, for the taking. So let‚Äôs take it on.

Not only does it harm the Indigenous individual being exploited, used, and appropriated solely for their Indigenous identity but it also puts projects at great risk. When major projects are at great risk, the investments made with intentions to reach communities are not realized, and the outcomes or impacts are not achieved. This means exacerbated socioeconomic inequities of Indigenous communities. This behaviour dictates how [or if] these project investments have true impact on the Canadian economy. There's significant negative economic impact of tokenism, appropriation, and exploitation of Indigenous Identity- to the country. It's not just an 'Indigenous problem'.

My idea of a 21st-century magazine consists of three pillars:

1. The Magazine itself, featuring original thoughts on the most interesting stories of our time.

2. Programs that study particular topics over a long period to produce valuable insights.

3. Live Events that engage people directly and invite them to ""join the discussion.""

This perspective is one that many individuals and businesses have across the country, this isn't new news.

It is a problematic perspective because it continues to uphold racism and systems of oppression. 

We are each, individually, and collectively, responsible to be righting relations and actively responding to Truth and Reconciliation Call to Action 92. 

It is phenomenally straightforward what we are meant to do, as example:
Listen to Indigenous voices.
Learn from Indigenous voices.
Invest in Indigenous voices.
Support Indigenous voices.
Be led by Indigenous voices.
Believe Indigenous voices.

When I think about folks who say they don't want to get it wrong so they aren't going to do anything, I wonder why they are so comfortable to share their very obvious tells that they haven't taken any of the above straightforward steps, that they aren't interested in taking a look within, and they have no concern about the harms they continue to uphold.

If you just don't know where to start, here is a suggestion, get in the room where Indigenous folks are leading and sharing. 

There is an incredible opportunity in Toronto this November and every sector I have been part of advertising, healthcare, tech, non-profit, tv and film, telecommunications absolutely have no reason to not be in this room. 

Let's get in this room and start shifting our individual and collective accountability into impactful actions that right relations and ensure prosperity for those whose lands we keep saying we live, work and play on.

Let's show up beyond our continued copy and paste acknowledgements of being on stolen land and step into dismantling the barriers we know exist and that we are benefitting from. #Reconciliation #IndigenousHistoryMonth #Indigenomics Indigenomics 4,887 followers 1y Edited The Indigenomics Institute welcomes Raylene Whitford and Frank Busch as conference emcees for Indigenomics on BAY STREET- the 100 billion dollar Indigenous economy conference, taking place November 21 - 23, 2023 in the City of Toronto !

It‚Äôs a way of #livingfromoneness .

We‚Äôre all in this earthship together - you do everything right and your country or economy or the climate goes sideways, there aren‚Äôt exemptions. Maybe you protect your people in the short run, but anything beyond crisis response we‚Äôre all together now, and that calls for new economies and governance models. 

A regenerative mindset is beyond sustainable- it‚Äôs deeply for life. Bridget McKenzie 9mo I've updated my new paper with this graphic. 
This paper aims to reframe and state the case for the roles of Culture in response to the Earth crisis, to generate new areas for investment and evidence-gathering. 

I've defined some key terms, set out how the Earth crisis is a ‚Äòculture crisis‚Äô, and identified the barriers to an effective Cultural response.

I then suggest some new thematic areas of Cultural practice. 

How can Culture be an agent for a shift to a Regenerative culture and respond to the emergency in ways that aim for Transformative Adaptation and Resilience?

WATCH; Anthony Viljoen , CEO, explain how the new ownership structure will accelerate development of its key assets in Namibia. 

Watch ‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/e3gURgDS Andrada Mining Limited‚ÄØ(AIM: ATM, OTCQB: ATMTF), the technology-metals producer with mining and exploration assets in Namibia,‚ÄØis seeking to increase the ownership of its main operating subsidiary (‚ÄúUTMC‚Äù) from 85% to 100%, through the acquisition of the 15% interest currently held by the Small Miners of Uis (""SMU""). 

Total consideration is to be satisfied through the issue of ¬£0.5m of ordinary shares in Andrada, ¬£0.78m in cash over 240 monthly instalments and the transfer of the Company‚Äôs 85% interest in license ML129, which is now non-core to Andrada, but regarded as a valuable opportunity for SMU to drive economic growth across the Erongo region in Namibia.  

Following completion of this transaction, Andrada will own 100% of UTMC, ensuring fair economic exposure to the development of the licenses in Namibia for all parties, further streamline operations for accelerated value creation and enable UTMC to apply for specific project financing solutions. 

Anthony Viljoen, Chief Executive Officer of Andrada‚ÄØexplains: 
- Why the restructuring process took so long 
- How the restructuring will help attract strategic partners to Andrada‚Äôs lithium assets 
- Why the lithium assets may soon‚ÄØaccount for approximately 70% of the company‚Äôs overall revenues 
‚ÄØ- How Andrada has become a‚ÄØtriple asset developer, producer and cashflow generator 
- Why the company‚Äôs tin assets are so valuable and why the  price rally in the metal will continue 
- The multiple revenue streams materialising from Andrada‚Äôs one mining operation strategy‚ÄØ 

Viljoen commented; ‚ÄúWe don't see this as a departure of our relationship with the SMU. In fact, if anything, it's strengthened our ties with them. It's given the SMU a renewed focus in terms of assisting us with our corporate social responsibilities and ensuring that our success on UIS is carried over to our other assets because a key part of this restructure is making sure that our entire portfolio realizes value.‚Äù‚ÄØ 

Reasons to add‚ÄØATM‚ÄØto your watchlist: 
- Andrada is a multi-asset, multi-commodity, multi-decade opportunity on multiple assets 
- Globally significant and JORC-compliant mineral resource estimate of 138 million tonnes 
- Open-pit mining, tin oxide coarse crushing, only being 230km from a port means low production costs and competitive logistics prices 
- Resource contains high purity lithium constituting of 0,73% at 1,45 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent 
- Andrada‚Äôs cash flow allows the company to develop its assets organically 
- The partnership with the‚ÄØBank of‚ÄØWindhoek‚ÄØmeans the company doesn‚Äôt have to solely rely on dilutive equity funding for development capital berenberg Tavistock Hannam & Partners #ATM #Andrada #Mining #Tin #Lithium #Namibia ‚Ä¶more Andrada Mining acquisition elevates the miner to‚ÄØemerging mid-tier status https://www.youtube.com/ 18 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in SearchSpace AI 243 followers 7mo Report this post Gold Fields is set to acquire Osisko Mining in a massive $2.16 billion all-cash dealüí∞

Vanessa is also the lead for the Lift Circle at Indigenous Lift Collective who are co-creating the conditions for Indigenous women entrepreneurs to thrive.

In our learning circle Vanessa offered two definitions of economic reconciliation:

‚ÄúEconomic reconciliation is a form of reconciliation in action. It is a commitment by all stakeholders involved to create meaningful paths of self-determination, relationships and equitable partnerships.‚Äù - Chief Leanne Joe

‚ÄúEconomic reconciliation is the space between the lived realities of Indigenous Peoples, the need to build understanding of the important Indigenous relationship, and the requirement for progressive actions for economic inclusion.‚Äù - Carol Anne Hilton

Last week Rexall Pharmacy Group ULC launched an Indigenous Wellness end aisle pilot in 10 locations across the country.¬†

Three brands owned and led by Mohawk, Cree and M√©tis¬†women entrepreneurs. Here is what they had to say about this pilot:

""This opportunity is Reconciliation in action. When you lift up female-led, Indigenous brands, you lift the entire Indigenous community.‚Äù April Mitchell-Boudreau founder Lofttan.

This wonderful partnership and unprecedented pilot program to support and promote Indigenous, women-owned businesses and brands is what the Indigenous community and this country needs. Angela DeMontigny founder Lodge Soy Candles.

‚ÄúAs a descendent of a residential school survivor, I am appreciative that Rexall is honouring the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada‚Äôs Calls to Action. kinan√¢skomitin (thank you, I am grateful to you).‚Äù Carrie Armstrong founder Mother Earth Essentials.

As individuals and as businesses we can each activate our economic reconciliation. Hire Indigenous leaders like Vanessa for learning circles. Purchase products from Indigenous owned businesses like Lofttan, Lodge Soy Candles, Mother Earth Essentials. Ask the businesses you support to start carrying Indigenous brands. #Reconciliation https://lnkd.in/g_ZZybPx 26 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 5,107 followers 1,645 Posts 9 Articles View Profile Connect More from this author Distinguished designer-in-residence Angela DeMontigny mentors students in the School of Fashion on creating ready-to-wear fashion that tells a story Angela DeMontigny 6y International Press Release World Indigenous Fashion Week¬Æ Angela DeMontigny 8y Hamilton's James St. N. is decorating for the HOLIDAYS!

A Truth and Reconciliation Day was announced, and tomorrow we commemorate the second annual recognition of the ongoing need for reconciliation in this country.

When it comes to #reconciliation , making long-term progress demands that our actions be grounded in accountability and transparency. Deloitte 's Reconciliation Action Plan year-two update report: Our progress on the shared path for reconciliation, shares some of the ongoing efforts we have made to fund Indigenous groups and their allies, adapt our systems, and provide resources for our employees to educate themselves about Indigenous culture. The road to reconciliation is long and, at times, challenging, but we continue to strive toward being better listeners and doing our part in contributing to reconciliation efforts. 
¬†
In honour of this important day, we have given our people tomorrow off in the hopes they will use this time to reflect and continue to educate themselves ‚Äì be it attending a workshop, reading a book from an Indigenous author, donating to a local Indigenous-run charity, or learning more about the rich culture and history of Indigenous peoples. On this day, and throughout the year, our primary focus must be to listen, learn, and do our part.¬†We hope our actions will serve as inspiration for others to do the same. https://lnkd.in/gVcfsg7U Our progress on the shared path for reconciliation | Deloitte Canada www2.deloitte.com 257 3 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Ailyn Bayubo Sales And Marketing Specialist at LAC Group 2y Report this comment Thanks for posting Like Reply 1¬†Reaction 2¬†Reactions Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D Founder of #Indigenomics movement- Indigenomics Institute, Global Centre Indigenomics & Indigenous Technology House.

Together, we are building an economy rooted in our traditions, knowledge, and sovereignty.""

As Indigenous peoples, we are not just participants in the economy; we are architects of a system that reflects our interconnectedness, sustainability, and collective prosperity. Economic justice means recognizing our inherent rights, fostering economic reconciliation, and creating pathways for economic sovereignty that benefit all.

We are witnessing a transformative era where Indigenous businesses, entrepreneurs, and nations are reclaiming their rightful place at the economic table. The future is being shaped by Indigenous leadership, collaborative partnerships, and a vision that respects the land, our values, and our people.

L'empire pharma, du digital et du g√©n√©tique tentent par ce trait√© de s'accaparer les savoirs ancestraux des 5000 peuples premiers de la Terre.

Cette conf√©rence de l'OMPI sur les ressources g√©n√©tiques et les connaissances traditionnelles a lieu en ce moment : du 13 au 24 mai 2024.

Le message de Barbara Steudler, qui suit de pr√®s cette affaire :
""Une grosse bataille se joue actuellement √† l'OMPI (WIPO en anglais) avec √† la cl√© un trait√© international sur la propri√©t√© intellectuelle relative √† certaines ressources et savoirs traditionnels des Peuples Autochtones. Concr√®tement, cela veut dire, par ex, pour les HuniKuin (peuple d'Amazonie) que le Kambo, ou l'Ayahuasca et tous leurs autres savoirs indig√®nes sont en jeu dans cette bataille autour de l'appropriation et du brevetage des savoirs traditionnels.

Il n'y a quasiment aucun m√©dia pr√©sent.

Mercredi 23 mai de la semaine prochaine, S√¥nia Guajajara, ministre au gouvernement br√©silien pour les Peuples autochtones, sera pr√©sente ici √† Gen√®ve.

Je suis avec l'√©quipe qui d√©fend les peuples premiers aux c√¥t√©s de Ninawa (chef Huni Kuin pr√©sent actuellement aux n√©gociations) - mais sans droit de vote, qui m'ont demand√© s'il serait possible pour vous de sensibiliser l'opinion pour parler de ces enjeux mondiaux (ou avec S√¥nia Guajajara) : il est sur Gen√®ve jusqu'√† samedi. Sonia sera l√† quant √† elle la semaine prochaine.

N'h√©sitez pas √† diffuser l'information ci-jointe, cela concerne directement les 5000 peuples autochtones de la plan√®te qui sont les gardiens des 80% de la biodiversit√© mondiale et qui se battent pour la Vie.

1. Gender Analysis- going beyond understanding the gender roles and power dynamics, and deeper into identifying gender gaps and bridging them.
2. Gender responsive budgeting-ensuring resources are allocated for inclusive participation. 
3. Gender Capacity Building- Designing a gender capacity-building program to ensure farmers, project staff, and community leaders have the skills and knowledge to support inclusive participation.
4. Gender-Sensitive Design and Planning- ensuring project interventions are accessible and beneficial to all. 
5.  Gender-Responsive Monitoring and Evaluation- Develop a gender-responsive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework to assess the program‚Äôs impact on men and women.

Sustainable Agriculture. Financial Inclusion.  Impact Investing 4mo Edited Report this post Agritech funding in Africa has stabilised, but the landscape is evolving. I like this piece with insights from David Saunders of Briter Bridges

While commercial funding has declined, non-commercial and semi-commercial investors are stepping up to support innovative solutions. This shift towards smaller deals and a focus on early-stage ventures is shaping the future of #agritech in #Africa . 

Gender diversity is crucial for a thriving agritech ecosystem. While there's been an increase in mixed-gender founding teams, all-women-founded teams still face significant challenges. According to Saunders, mixed-gender founding teams saw their share of funding increase from 7% in 2023 to 15% currently. However, all-women-founded teams still account for only 2% of total funding. 

Saunders believes the agritech funding bubble has deflated but can still be sustained. While non-commercial support is crucial, continued commercial interest is needed to prevent further decline. To ensure long-term impact, stakeholders must balance innovation with sustainability. https://lnkd.in/d59nqHyV #agriculture #funding | Jacques Taylor | Mercy Corps AgriFin 6 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Lisa Satolli Project Lead, Humanitarian and Resilience Investing at World Economic Forum 10mo Report this post Very excited to share Proparco's new Private Sector & Development (SP&D) magazine!

En cette matin√©e se tiendra un exercice intellectuel de haute vol√©e au sein du Brookings Institution; ce l√©gendaire think tank qui demeure une r√©f√©rence mondiale parmi les grands temples du savoir en science politique, relations internationales, science √©conomique et, plus largement, la Mecque de la prospective. Cet √©v√©nement marquera la publication du rapport tant attendu sur la prospective africaine et les grands enjeux pour l‚ÄôAfrique √† l‚Äôhorizon 2025-2030.

√âternels fianc√©s g√©opolitiques du monde entier, les dirigeants africains continuent de nous d√©soler. D√®s qu‚Äôils sont appel√©s aux quatre coins du globe, ils accourent avec une docilit√© d√©sarmante. En revanche, tout effort visant √† les mobiliser pour b√¢tir des laboratoires de r√©flexion endog√®ne est balay√© d‚Äôun revers de main.

Cela dit, saluons ce rapport de haute facture, qui a r√©ussi √† rassembler de nombreux intellectuels africains sous l‚Äô√©gide de la Brookings Institution. L‚Äôann√©e intellectuelle africaine d√©marre ainsi sous de prometteuses augures.  
Une v√©ritable constellation de cerveaux d‚Äôexception a travaill√© sur ce sujet crucial, parmi lesquels Ahunna Eziakonwa, Secr√©taire g√©n√©rale adjointe et Directrice r√©gionale pour l‚ÄôAfrique au sein du Programme des Nations Unies pour le d√©veloppement (PNUD). Ahunna, qui fut ma toute premi√®re sup√©rieure √† l‚ÄôONU, m‚Äôavait recrut√©e au Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires en tant que point focal pour le Conseil de s√©curit√©.

La seule Camerounaise de cet ar√©opage d‚Äôexcellence est Vera Songwe, preuve que, malgr√© les critiques des ¬´ aboyeurs du dimanche ¬ª et autres ¬´ professeurs Tournesol ¬ª, le Cameroun tient sa place sur la sc√®ne internationale et dialogue avec la mondialit√©. Je vais √©couter attentivement et ma proposition a √©t√© retenue au cours du weekend par les organisateurs et sera soumise aux deux Chef d'Etats. Deux des meilleurs sur le continent en termes de r√©sultats.

Deux pr√©sidents africains: Paul Kagame et Duma Boko:  Une institution √©trang√®re, bien loin de l‚ÄôAfrique, accueille ainsi cet √©v√©nement, t√©moignant de l‚Äôimportance que rev√™t ce genre de r√©flexion dans des enceintes internationales prestigieuses.

Ce type d‚Äôexercice √©tait autrefois pris√© par la D√©l√©gation aux affaires strat√©giques (DAS) du minist√®re des Arm√©es en France. Mais, h√©las.                              ----------------

A coalition of more than 25 National Indigenous Organizations has unveiled a new National Indigenous Economic Strategy (NIES), the first such strategy to be built and designed exclusively by Indigenous leaders, institutions, and organizations from across¬†Canada. 

Research has found that if the gap in opportunities for Indigenous communities was closed, it would result in a boost of more than¬†$30 billion¬†to¬†Canada's¬†GDP.¬†
 
Further, if Indigenous peoples had equitable access to economic opportunities, 135,000 more First Nations, M√©tis, and Inuit individuals would be employed, bringing in¬†$6.9 billion¬†per year in employment income. 

At the same time, reducing poverty among Indigenous peoples would save federal and provincial/territorial governments more than¬†$8 billion¬†a year. https://bit.ly/3NZ5BTs Growing the Canadian Economy: New National Indigenous Economic Strategy is an economic stimulus for Canada 8 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 456 followers 8 Posts View Profile Follow Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

Indigenomics Institute founder Carol Anne Hilton says the number serves as a motivational ‚Äúmarker‚Äù to which Indigenous businesses can aspire. Bill Lomax, CEO of the First Nations Bank of Canada, says that lessons he learned in the U.S. can be used to reach the goal. They include getting governments and companies to increase their use of Indigenous suppliers, as well as expanding the community's presence in the gaming and cannabis industries. Editors‚Äô Picks Lynne Groulx Member of Metis Nation Ontario, human rights defender, resiliency lodge builder, reconciliation believer. 1y Report this post Strategic partnerships with Indigenous-led businesses will create new jobs and opportunities. It also means there is a potential for Indigenous-led businesses to grow into a huge, multi-billion-dollar economy.

What‚Äôs required is a mix of the right policies that Canada does not have right now. We need to ensure government procurement creates space for sourcing from Indigenous-led businesses. We also must see greater alliances between the business community and Indigenous-owned enterprises.

As we‚Äôve seen, Indigenous Women and Gender-Diverse+ Peoples are leading the way in creating new and exciting businesses that make a big impact in their local communities and create economic growth.
Supporting these small businesses with the right tools to grow creates hope.

As Indigenomics CEO Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D said:

In an era of rapid technological advancement, the intersection of AI, blockchain, and pharmacoeconomics is redefining how we approach pharmaceutical supply chains. A recent paper by Adekola, Kassem, and Mbata (2022) highlights how these innovations can enhance efficiency, transparency, and equity in drug distribution, particularly in underserved regions.

üîπ AI can optimise demand forecasting and supply chain logistics, reducing waste and ensuring timely drug availability.

üîπ Blockchain fosters transparency and security, combating counterfeit drugs and improving traceability.

üîπ Pharmacoeconomics ensures that cost-effectiveness remains at the core, making treatments more accessible and sustainable.

This convergence represents a paradigm shift‚Äîone that could democratise global drug access and improve patient outcomes worldwide. But to realise its full potential, collaboration across industries is key.

üí° What are your thoughts on integrating these technologies into pharma supply chains? Are we ready for this shift?

Exp: 4IR Humanity Work | Sustainable Digital Economy W3 Deep Tech: DLT, AI, Quantum in Business, Neuro Systems Design & Visual Communication 1mo Edited Report this post While the World Talks DeepSeek, the Black Swan Summit Asks: What‚Äôs Next?
The global AI landscape just shifted. DeepSeek-R1, an -actually- open-source AI model, is outperforming current top-tier models while drastically undercutting costs. Silicon Valley is in crisis mode. Investors are recalibrating. While the mainstream debate focuses on ""Who leads AI?"", we are already preparing for ""What happens next?""

üîπ How do we balance national security concerns, tech standards, and regulation with the need for global AI collaboration?
üîπ Will open-source AI become the dominant force, making proprietary models obsolete? And will this boost SMEs innovation, productivity and competitiveness?
üîπ How will this innovation speed up the coming of AI Agents and their impact on business and finance? 
üîπ How can we use technologies like blockchain to govern and control AI models?
üîπ If DeepSeek can achieve cutting-edge AI with just a fraction of the compute and energy, what does this mean for future of the AI infrastructure including energy?
üîπ How should investors position themselves in Western Australia‚Äîhome to some of the world‚Äôs cheapest renewable energy sources and the next generation of green AI data centres?
üîπ If DeepSeek-style AI is 90% cheaper than Western labour, which industries are most at risk of automation?
üîπ What privacy and ethical concerns will emerge next? 

üåè Join us in Perth as we dissect the economic, regulatory, and technological implications of AI‚Äôs rapid evolution‚Äîand uncover the opportunities shaping the future.

Binance Labs has rebranded to YZi Labs, expanding its focus beyond blockchain to include artificial intelligence and biotechnology investments, with former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao taking an active mentoring role and former co-founder Ella Zhang returning to lead the incubator. The organization will reintroduce a 12-week in-person residency program for founders and has already made strategic investments in AI companies like Sahara AI and MyShell, as well as the decentralized science project BIO Protocol.

The expansion into decentralized science (DeSci) represents a move into financing life-saving medicine through blockchain technology, using tokenized incentives, smart contracts, and DAOs to enable capital formation and collaboration. This emerging sector is gaining recognition beyond crypto, exemplified by ResearchHub 's feature in Nature journal in December 2024 for its crypto-based peer review platform. #Innovation #YZiLabs #BlockchainAI 2 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Bean Infosystems 2,685 followers 3mo Report this post In an environment characterized by fast technological advancement, IT consulting is forced to act as an innovator. AI, blockchain, and quantum computing among other technologies have now started to redefine sectors and bring about new problems and unimagined possibilities.

Thanks Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D for your fireside chat on how boards can recognise the need to set the stage on how to grow the story of Indigenous economic potential through #indigenomics and how companies can truly embrace #truth and #reconciliation . Indigenomics is a collective economic response to the legacy of the systemic exclusion of Indigenous peoples in Canada‚Äôs economic development. It is a platform for economic reconciliation on the balance sheet of Canada, and not being viewed as a liability.

Indigenous groups and communities have celebrated their culture and heritage on June 21 because the significance of summer solstice. National Indigenous People‚Äôs Day is also part of the month long Celebrate Canada program, which also includes Saint Jean-Baptist‚Äôs Day (June 24), Multicultural Day (June 27) and Canada Day (July 1).

The day was first celebrated in 1996, after it was proclaimed that year by then¬†Governor General of Canada¬†Rom√©o LeBlanc, to be celebrated annually on June 21.

To build respectful relationships, acknowledging the land is an important part of reconciliation. It honours the authentic history of North America, its original people and tells the story of the creation of this country that has historically been missing.

The indigenous people although they comprise only 6.2% of the world's population, safeguard 80% of the planet's biodiversity. Through diverse community-led actions ‚Äì such as¬†community-owned renewable energy projects, land-based education initiatives, cross-cultural climate conversations, language revitalization programs, and ceremony¬†‚Äì communities are reconnecting with their traditional knowledges, cultures, spiritualities, and lands.

Today, I take a moment to express our deepest gratitude and respect for the First Nations communities and their invaluable contributions to the rich, diverse social fabric of Canada.

For thousands of years, First Nations peoples have inhabited and cared for the lands we now call Canada. Their profound knowledge, cultural practices, and spiritual traditions have not only shaped the environment but also the very essence of what it means to be Canadian.

Cultural Heritage: The vibrant art, music, dance, and storytelling traditions of First Nations enrich our cultural mosaic. From the intricate beadwork and carvings to the powerful drum circles and powwows, their creative expressions inspire and unite us.

Stewardship of the Land: First Nations have long been the stewards of the land, advocating for sustainable practices and environmental conservation. Their deep connection to nature teaches us the importance of living in harmony with our surroundings and protecting our planet for future generations.

Community and Values: The values of community, respect, and interconnectedness championed by First Nations serve as a guiding light for all Canadians. Their emphasis on kinship, mutual support, and respect for all living beings offers us a blueprint for a more inclusive and compassionate society.

Wisdom and Knowledge: The wisdom passed down through generations of First Nations Elders and Knowledge Keepers is a treasure trove of understanding and insight. Their teachings on health, governance, and justice enrich our collective knowledge and pave the way for a more equitable future.

As we move forward, it is crucial to continue recognizing and honoring the contributions of First Nations peoples. Let us commit to fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of their cultures, histories, and rights. Together, we can build a Canada that respects and celebrates its First Nations heritage.

Miigwech, Hiy Hiy, and thank you to all First Nations communities for your enduring legacy and for helping to create a stronger, more diverse, and united Canada.

According to our #Scorecard report ( https://bit.ly/3vEuTCX ), representation of First Nations, Inuit, and M√©tis in management positions ‚¨á decreased to 2.4% in 2023 from 2.7% the previous year. Tabatha Bull , President and CEO of the Canadian Council for Indigenous Business emphasizes the importance of understanding why these numbers declined and suggests three ways for corporate Canada to transform their approach to #recruiting and #retaining Indigenous leadership:

üí° 1) Change the decision-making process at the board level. Consider embracing consensus decision-making and recognize that Indigenous Peoples may take time to assess the long-term impact of decisions on future generations.

üí° 2) Focus on recruiting for potential, not just experience. Relying solely on a candidate's years of experience will restrict the pool of Indigenous talent.

üí° 3) Prioritize intentional training and development. Ensure Indigenous hires receive the necessary training to prepare them for leadership roles.

As we enter 2025, Canadians are navigating a landscape shaped by economic anxiety, regional disparities, and generational divides. Here are some key insights shaping our nation:

üí∞ Economic Anxiety: Rising costs, inflation, and housing unaffordability dominate concerns, creating a ‚Äúscarcity mindset‚Äù that impacts everyday life.

üè° Regional Divisions: From western skepticism of federal climate policies to Ontario‚Äôs housing crisis and Quebec‚Äôs cultural distinctiveness, divisions are stark.

üë• Generational Divide: Fragmented information consumption, older Canadians on traditional media, younger ones on platforms like TikTok, creates challenges for national unity.

üéØ Political Opportunity: With traditional partisan lines blurring, Canadians are looking for bold leadership that prioritizes affordability, job creation, and tangible solutions over ideology.

As voters seek competence and stability, 2025 offers a critical moment for leaders to bridge divides and deliver on economic and social challenges. The path forward will require empathy, innovation, and a commitment to uniting a divided nation.

Carol Anne Hilton, founder of the Indigenomics Institute, sees a ""tidal wave"" of Indigenous business growth driven by increased access to capital and improved internet in rural areas. Indigenous women, in particular, are leading the way, starting businesses at five times the national rate and securing roles on corporate boards. Hilton, an award-winning leader from the Nuu chah nulth Nation, sees this growth as a step toward economic reconciliation.

According to Hilton, the rise in Indigenous entrepreneurship is also due to a changing mindset in Canada‚Äôs banking sector. As Indigenous leaders now hold positions on the boards of major financial institutions, new doors are opening for Indigenous business ventures.

Hilton‚Äôs book, Indigenomics: Taking a Seat at the Economic Table, aims to ignite a $100 billion Indigenous economy. This November, the Indigenomics Institute will host a 24-hour Indigenous global economic forum, spotlighting 36 speakers to discuss the future of Indigenous business.

But now, Indigenous communities are delivering sustainable solutions to a wide range of issues and reshaping the modern economy. 

With more than 476 million Indigenous people living in 90 countries across the world, building positive connections is crucial. And with Indigenous businesses gathering momentum, playing an important role in reshaping modern economies and driving reconciliation, it has become a force that can no longer be ignored.

In Australia, the number of Indigenous businesses increased by more than 47 percent between 2016 and 2021, with their collective contribution to the Australian economy rising at least 59 percent to sit in the range of A$8.5 billion (US$5.5 billion) to A$12 billion (US$7.8 billion).

In Canada, the Indigenous economy was valued at US$35.9 billion in 2020, around 2.2 percent of Canada‚Äôs gross domestic product. The Toronto-based Indigenomics Institute is confident it is on track to more than triple in size and is working to secure the Indigenous business sector‚Äôs place at the table.

In New Zealand, the last 10 years has seen the MƒÅori asset base grow at a significantly faster rate than the overall economy to a current valuation of more than US$42.5 billion. According to forecasts, it will reach US$60.8 billion by 2030.

In modern business, we seem to forget the symbiotic nature of ‚Äòwho‚Äô we are delivering to, and only focus on ‚Äòwhat‚Äô we are doing. Traditional business, on the other hand, is always¬†focused on relationships before the business. 

If the founders and entrepreneurs focus on building these relationships and solve for real-world problems, we will create greater value for not only those communities but for the whole world, while protecting traditions and creating the world a better place. #entrepreneurship #innovation #problemsolving #indigenousbusinesses Harnessing Indigenous innovation boosts opportunities for all theceomagazine.com 2 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Anmol Rattan Singh Policy Researcher | Co-Founder, PANJ Foundation 7mo Report this post I read this interesting piece a while back, and here‚Äôs my brief take on it. https://lnkd.in/giEyPVPd It's safe to say that most of us are acutely aware that the bedrock of development in Punjab‚Äîand indeed, across the Global South‚Äîrests on the shoulders of knowledge equity. The notion of providing economic advisory support is not just about offering expertise; it's about empowering local voices, fostering innovation, and challenging the entrenched hierarchies of perspectives.

Punjab, with its dynamic socio-economic landscape, is uniquely positioned to lead by example. Yet, we must confront the reality that knowledge inequities have often stifled our region's potential to influence its own development trajectory. When foreign experts dominate the discourse, we risk sidelining the very voices that are most attuned to the complexities and nuances of our local context.

At PANJ (Policy Advisory and Network for Joint Progress) Foundation, we believe that true progress in Punjab requires an entrepreneurial approach to redressing these inequities. This isn't merely a matter of fairness‚Äîit's a strategic imperative. This diversity is crucial, especially when grappling with the ""wicked"" problems that require innovative, interdisciplinary solutions.

We must also redefine what it means to be an ""expert"". Expertise should be recognised not solely by published papers or foreign credentials but by an individual's deep understanding of local contexts and their capacity to innovate within them. This redefinition can unlock a wealth of untapped potential within Punjab, ensuring that our region's development is driven by those who live and breathe its challenges and opportunities.

Moreover, addressing knowledge inequities in Punjab is not just about levelling the playing field‚Äîit's about future-proofing our economic and development strategies. By investing in local talent and fostering strategic partnerships, we can build robust knowledge systems that are resilient and adaptable to the demands of an ever-evolving global economy.

The time for action is now. Let us engage in this critical dialogue, challenge the status quo, and together, lay the foundation for a more equitable and prosperous future for Punjab. PANJ Foundation is committed to being at the forefront of this movement, and we invite thinkers, innovators, and change-makers to join us in this mission.

Dustin Hoffman‚Äôs Benjamin's ear as the ultimate ""secret to success"" advice in the movie, The Graduate.

Productivity. Conservatives, bank and think tank studies, and rhetoric in media is already mounting. It will emerge as a slick, manufactured election issue for Canadians. 

Increased productivity, meaning essentially increasing sales, removing regulatory hurdles, while producing more, faster at lower cost, increases GDP, and the potential to create wealth ---for all but in truth, primarily for foreign/domestic owners/ shareholders. Trickle down economics rhetoric rides again. 

Investment in productivity centered tech and innovation is not in itself bad. The issue is where the wealth it creates goes. 

Not to us.

Surely we have learned?

In this time in our collective history, GDP growth via increased productivity with continued ecological rape and significant increase in taxation of corporate wealth created is the wrong thing to focus on if we want all life to thrive and live in balance.  In today's world, that means reclaiming, increasing funding to, and public soverign control of land, housing, healthy local food, healthcare, essential infrastructure, and investment in and all-access to world class education opportunities. 

A corporate and business elite defined and motivated productivity agenda helps the few and not the many. Don't be fooled. Again. 

If The Graduate was re made today, I like to believe it would feature a loving radical, modern socialist, intersectional feminist Aunty, in clear voice at a Palestinian protest rally (not a Rosedale party) passionately cupping Benjamin's face, saying honey, its ""peace, solidarity, post growth economics"". #postgrowth #productivity Growth is enriching an elite and killing the planet.

It's about fostering partnerships that respect Indigenous sovereignty, culture, and rights, and creating economic opportunities that benefit both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians.

Today I got to hear from leading experts in the field of Indigenous Economic reconciliation. Lindsay Brant, M.Ed, PhD Candidate (ABD). , Jarret Leaman , Rhode Thomas , Shyra Barberstock, PhD , Rye Karonhiowanen Barberstock, PhD , spoke beautifully on the colonial systems that exist within Canada, and the barriers to breaking down said systems.

For many years, the economic marginalization of Indigenous communities has contributed to the socio-economic gaps that we see today. Economic reconciliation seeks to address these disparities by ensuring that Indigenous peoples have equitable access to resources, opportunities, and decision-making processes. The Canadian Government follows a requirement for federal departments and agencies ensures a minimum 5% of the total value of contracts are held by Indigenous businesses, a number in line with the population percentage of Indigenous peoples on Turtle Island.

Investing in Indigenous partnerships means tapping into rich cultural heritage, innovative business practices, and a growing market of consumers who value social responsibility. It‚Äôs a chance to learn from each other and build a more inclusive economy that respects and incorporates Indigenous knowledge and traditions. 

I learned today that the Land we live on can be seen as curriculum, a curriculum we need to understand, respect, and implement in our business practices. 

How are you incorporating principles of economic reconciliation in your business? I would love to hear practical solutions I myself could implement!

Together, let‚Äôs honour the land we are on. I acknowledge that I live and work on the traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Wendat peoples. 14 3 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Pharis Mavia Sales representative at LEJA.

Director at Catering angels üçúüç≤ 4mo Report this post Today, we gather to celebrate the incredible strides made by many countries that were once labeled as ""third world"" nations. These countries, often underestimated, have demonstrated resilience, adaptability, and ambition, transforming challenges into remarkable growth stories. The term ""third world"" may imply a position behind the rest of the world, but the reality we see today tells a different story‚Äîone of rapid development, innovation, and a drive to reshape their futures.

One of the driving forces behind this economic growth is the entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in these nations. With young, ambitious populations, many countries are investing in small and medium enterprises, providing platforms for job creation and wealth generation at the grassroots level. This momentum has paved the way for a burgeoning middle class, which, in turn, stimulates demand for goods, services, and infrastructure.

Moreover, we cannot overlook the role of technology in this transformation. Mobile technology, for instance, has redefined access to banking and financial services, particularly in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. In East Africa, for example, mobile payment systems like M-Pesa have revolutionized commerce, enabling millions to participate in the economy without needing a bank account. This digital revolution is creating unprecedented opportunities for financial inclusion and economic participation.

Another crucial factor in this economic growth is the commitment of these countries to invest in education and skill development. Governments are increasingly prioritizing education, recognizing that a skilled workforce is vital to a competitive economy. From vocational training programs to partnerships with international educational institutions, these investments are equipping the youth with the tools they need to succeed in the global market.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) has also played a pivotal role. Investors worldwide are recognizing the potential of emerging markets and are channeling funds into industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, technology, and renewable energy. In fact, some of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing economies today are in Africa and Southeast Asia, where foreign investments are creating jobs and infrastructure and driving exports.

Ladies and gentlemen, while these achievements are cause for celebration, there is still much work ahead. Many of these nations continue to face challenges related to income inequality, political stability, and environmental sustainability. However, the positive trajectory we see today gives us reason for optimism. With continued commitment to sustainable growth, investment in people, and innovation, these countries are well on their way to shaping a future where they stand not behind but alongside the world‚Äôs most developed economies.

Let us be inspired by their journey and look forward to a world where opportunity, prosperity, and success are truly global. 6 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in GOALOOP¬Æ - Connecting the World through Goals¬Æ 615 followers 9mo Report this post Shrink the #Economy , Save the World?

Economic #growth has been ecologically costly ‚Äî and so a movement in favor of ‚Äòdegrowth‚Äô is growing. Techno-optimists place their faith in #innovation ; degrowthers place theirs in social movements. Both sides lay claim to being the genuine realists. Each insists that we simply don‚Äôt have enough time to do what the other side wants.

‚ÄúGains in economic growth have too often buoyed the fortunes of the richest instead of lifting all boats. Prosperity even in the most prosperous countries hasn‚Äôt been shared. But all the attention to #inequality is just a crack in the edifice of economic orthodoxy. Now a much more radical proposition has emerged, looming like a wrecking ball: Is economic growth desirable at all?

[...] today there is a burgeoning ‚Äúpost-growth‚Äù and ‚Äúdegrowth‚Äù movement [...] 

‚ÄòA Poverty of Imagination‚Äô

Given how keenly the degrowth movement disavows coercion, how is this wholesale transformation supposed to happen? ‚ÄúSeeds of degrowth communism are sprouting all over the world,‚Äù Saito writes, pointing to experiments in local governance in cities like Barcelona, which has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050, and farming cooperatives in South Africa.

Even degrowth‚Äôs skeptics may find that Saito‚Äôs examples of grass-roots organizing sound agreeably democratic and improvisational. But the prospect of global apocalypse that degrowthers keep emphasizing also has the perverse effect of making local measures sound acutely inadequate. Still, Saito says that such experiments do offer something crucial: an enlarged sense of what‚Äôs possible. Degrowth‚Äôs critics, he writes, suffer from ‚Äúa poverty of imagination that simply accepts the status quo as unchangeable.‚Äù

As it happens, Susskind says precisely the same thing but in the reverse: that it‚Äôs degrowth‚Äôs advocates who suffer from a ‚Äúlack of imagination.‚Äù The mirrored accusations are striking. Maybe it isn‚Äôt a matter so much of imagination scarcity as of where that imagination is directed. Techno-optimists place their faith in innovation; degrowthers place theirs in social movements. Both sides lay claim to being the genuine realists. Each insists that we simply don‚Äôt have enough time to do what the other side wants.

The intransigence of such zero-sum disputes is a reminder of why win-win fantasies are so attractive in the first place. Whatever the profound differences between degrowth‚Äôs proponents and their critics, the scale of the climate crisis suggests one point of convergence: We need all the imaginative help we can get.‚Äù

Over the past 15 years, I suspect that over $1,000,000 of Indigenous-specific post-secondary scholarships and bursaries have been accessed by pretendians. This misuse highlights a significant flaw in the current self-identification process for some scholarships, which often requires no documentation to prove Indigenous identity.

Many post-secondary institutions and private sector businesses allow applicants to self-identify as Indigenous without requiring any proof. In contrast, Indigenous organizations such as the National Indian Brotherhood Trust, Chief Joe Mathias, and Lilwat Nation mandate documentation like a status card or a community letter.

Having been in post-secondary education since 2010, I‚Äôve observed that only about 20% of recipients of Indigenous scholarships or bursaries seemed authentically Indigenous, explicitly sharing their community, language, and culture. The remaining 80%, often vaguely identifying as M√©tis without specifying their community, appeared to exploit the self-identification process, thereby diverting much-needed financial support from genuinely Indigenous students.

The case of the Gill twins is a notable example of this exploitation going unpunished, and I believe there are many more cases out there. It‚Äôs clear that the self-identification process is flawed and primarily benefits pretendians.

We must eliminate self-identification for Indigenous scholarships to ensure that resources dedicated to Indigenous Peoples are used to close the socioeconomic gap for those who truly need and deserve it. #IndigenousScholarships #EducationEquity #StopPretendians #AuthenticityMatters 117 16 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Roxanne M. Learning my Sechelt Language 9mo Report this comment What I have found is that institutions will not question their identity.  I have met some individuals who have ticked that box and I know and they know they are not indigenous but receive bursaries, etc meanwhile the student who is working hard and is recognized by their band is overlooked.

I am your Leader 9mo Report this comment This is an example of where I definitely feel the word pretendian is justified and needs attention and to be addressed immediately.

You are correct in your believed that there are more cases like this where people are taking advantage and fraudulently claiming benefits. There‚Äôs organizations that are involved in this and recommending it to clients.

I am hearing of African folks who just arrived utilizing benefits on top of other stuff and it‚Äôs just insane. 

There  all kinds of groups that have been funded by government that are getting extra money claiming to serve indigenous people and communities and it‚Äôs totally a scam, they offer something that they put together but have never served an indigenous person nor do they plan to. Environmental groups also preying on indigenous to obtain funding. It‚Äôs sick, so hard to trust anyone‚Ä¶ would be nice to get to a point where we don‚Äôt depend on government money and be able to protect it.

This is actually an issue that matters and not the nonsense of shaming someone for having feathers in their hair.

This needs to be shut down for sure, please let me what steps we can take to stop this. Reporting them is difficult I think there needs to be an audit and some legislation to prevent this.

I am your Leader 9mo Report this comment They say that this is a ‚Äúcomplex issue‚Äù but it actually is not. The government just needs a solution that works.

The main problem is that these schools and programs they don‚Äôt care, not at all, cos for them it‚Äôs guaranteed enrolment and money.

I personally don‚Äôt have a problem with someone  doing this that is not native but is a supporter and advocate and has a solid understanding of the culture and like whatever‚Ä¶.

BUT if someone is doing this for the purposes of just taking advantage and not contributing anything to indigenous culture or straight up taking it away from potential candidates then that is very wrong and this issue has now escalated to a point where it‚Äôs out of control.

I truly feel like the #1 issue is that the benefits and burseries are just simply not advertised to the indigenous communities enough. There needs to be some kind of rule or campaign where they are actively going to people who need these programs the most, and making them aware that it‚Äôs available, that would start filling up spots and weeding out the bad seeds.

Because the flip side of this - is sometimes we‚Äôve got applicants who‚Äôve been severely impacted by 60‚Äôs scoop, Bill C-31 or the enfranchisement act to name a few where there needs to be special considerations where there is no proof of First Nations, metis or Inuit status. 

These acts where people don‚Äôt qualify take away from those who should be getting the scholarships & bursaries & honestly it‚Äôs theft, it‚Äôs lying, it‚Äôs cheating.  

Great way to start careers - just saying! Mason Ducharme PhD | Indigenous Executive & Capacity-Building Scholar | Specialist in Indigenous Governance 9mo üì¢ Calling for a Change: Strengthening Verification for Indigenous Scholarships

Over the past 15 years, I suspect that over $1,000,000 of Indigenous-specific post-secondary scholarships and bursaries have been accessed by pretendians. This misuse highlights a significant flaw in the current self-identification process for some scholarships, which often requires no documentation to prove Indigenous identity.

Many post-secondary institutions and private sector businesses allow applicants to self-identify as Indigenous without requiring any proof. In contrast, Indigenous organizations such as the National Indian Brotherhood Trust, Chief Joe Mathias, and Lilwat Nation mandate documentation like a status card or a community letter.

Having been in post-secondary education since 2010, I‚Äôve observed that only about 20% of recipients of Indigenous scholarships or bursaries seemed authentically Indigenous, explicitly sharing their community, language, and culture. The remaining 80%, often vaguely identifying as M√©tis without specifying their community, appeared to exploit the self-identification process, thereby diverting much-needed financial support from genuinely Indigenous students.

The case of the Gill twins is a notable example of this exploitation going unpunished, and I believe there are many more cases out there. It‚Äôs clear that the self-identification process is flawed and primarily benefits pretendians.

We must eliminate self-identification for Indigenous scholarships to ensure that resources dedicated to Indigenous Peoples are used to close the socioeconomic gap for those who truly need and deserve it. #IndigenousScholarships #EducationEquity #StopPretendians #AuthenticityMatters 1 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 247Update News 457 followers 5mo Report this post Pakistan's Ministry of Religious Affairs established scholarships for non-Muslim students to improve educational prospects for the country's minority communities, which make up fewer than 5% of the total population.

These programs provide financial assistance for tuition, stipends, book allowances, and travel awards depending on academic performance, financial need, and citizenship.

In a thought-provoking article, Maleke Fourati, Associate Professor at the South Mediterranean University ‚Äì Mediterranean School of Business (SMU-MSB), currently on leave at the University of French Polynesia, explores the lingering effects of colonial influence on educational institutions in #Tunisia .

The study reveals that the enrolment of Tunisian students in colonial primary schools has significantly influenced literacy rates for decades. Notably, a 1% increase in enrolment in 1931 is linked to an approximate 1.8 percentage point rise in literacy by 2014. This enduring legacy highlights education‚Äôs crucial role in breaking the cycle of poverty.

Since gaining independence, Tunisia has made remarkable progress in reducing educational disparities, achieving near-universal primary education by 2014. However, challenges persist, especially regarding the quality of education.

Fourati stresses that while our history impacts our present, it doesn‚Äôt dictate our future. By implementing effective policies and investing consistently in education, we can create a brighter path ahead. #Education #Tunisia #ColonialLegacy #Literacy #PolicyImpact Read here https://bit.ly/4eMQD0s Addressing the lingering effects of colonial influence on educational institutions cepr.org 1 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Pak-Afghan Youth Forum 725 followers 2mo Report this post Pakistan‚Äôs Commitment to Muslim Girls' Education at the Global Conference

Department of Procurement & Supply Chain Management at Makerere University Business School 4mo Report this post The age restrictions imposed by many scholarship programs targeting Africans are not only unrealistic but also profoundly unjust. Imagine a PhD scholarship for a needy African with an age limit of 35 years. Such limitations fail to acknowledge the unique challenges faced by numerous African students, thereby denying opportunities to those who have demonstrated immense resilience and determination. In many African countries, the journey to higher education is anything but straightforward. It is a path marked by significant personal sacrifice and unwavering perseverance. Many students start going to School late due to the long walk from home to school and back. In other cases, along the way, many students must balance their studies with work to support themselves and their families, which requires taking breaks from their education to earn money or dealing with life events such as early marriage or pregnancy, further delaying their academic progress. Such realities make it impossible for many African students to adhere to traditional educational timelines. So, when scholarships impose age limits, they exclude those who have had to navigate these non-traditional paths. I feel that a student who has worked for years to save for university fees or a young mother returning to school after raising her children is no less deserving of financial aid than someone who followed a more conventional route. 4 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Patrick Otundo Educator, Instructional Designer, Author, Writer 4mo Report this post A Brief History of Education in Kenya During the Pre-Colonial and Colonial Epochs

The education system has evolved from the pre-colonial, colonial, post-colonial right into the 21st century, influenced chiefly by individuals and committees appointed by the government. 

Since of these individuals were appointed by the government, most of their recommendations were based on prevailing political realities. This article describes how the Kenyan education system has evolved over the years.

Pre-colonial Education

Even though formal schooling was unheard of before the Europeans arrived in Kenya, there existed a form of education whose primary aim was acculturation or transmission of culture from generation to generation. 

The purpose of education in pre-colonial Kenya was to teach the community‚Äôs cultural practices to the young. 

The philosophy of education at that time tended to be more pragmatic as the older members of society would spend time teaching children the skills they needed for their day-to-day survival.

Colonial Education

During the colonial era, education was mainly to convert Africans to Christianity and create a skilled labor force for the colonial enterprise. 

Africans were required to acquire practical skills such as agriculture, carpentry, and masonry to work for European settlers. 

This happened in both missionary and government schools across the country. 

The first formal school in Kenya was established in 1846 by Ludwig Krapf and Johan Rebmann, two missionaries working with the Church Missionary Society (CMS).

According to Mackatiani C. et al., education before the 1908 Fraser Commission did not discriminate against students on account of their race.

The Fraser Commission was the first to recommend the segregation of the education system, with Africans getting training in practical skills, Indians in technical skills, and Europeans in academic-oriented disciplines. 

From the early 1920s to the early 1930s, the government established schools in Narok, Kericho, Kajiado, Tambach, Loitoktok, Kakamega, and Kagumo. 

In 1949, Beecher led a government-appointed committee to establish the Royal Technical College, which became the University of Nairobi. 1 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Startup Pakistan 761,582 followers 5mo Report this post Pakistan‚Äôs Ministry of Religious Affairs announced scholarships aimed at non-Muslim students to enhance educational opportunities for minority communities, which constitute less than 5% of the population.

A significant portion of these submissions, rather than fostering constructive dialogue, have sought to rally academic #unions against the agency. This rising tide of dissent calls for a measured and intellectually grounded response, one that transcends emotion and embraces reason, offering a balanced perspective on this critical issue.

While it is understandable that some may feel concerned about the suspension of foreign scholarships by TETFund, it is important to approach this issue with a balanced and pragmatic perspective.

1. The Temporary Nature of the Suspension:
The word suspension signifies a temporary halt, not a permanent decision. This suggests that the program can be reinstated once the underlying challenges are addressed.

2. Valid Reasons for the Suspension:
TETFund has cited two key issues:

Abuse of the Scholarship: Unfortunately, many beneficiaries now view the scholarship as a pathway to permanent emigration ( _Japa_ ), rather than a means to gain #knowledge and return to contribute to #national #development (A grave concern).

Exchange Rate Crisis: With the #naira struggling against the #dollar , the funds that once supported thousands will now barely cover a few, through no fault of the agency.

3. Empathy and Pragmatism:
If we were in the position of the TETFund Secretary, would we continue to fund a program that yields diminishing returns? The logical decision would be to pause, reassess, and explore alternative solutions.


4. The Way Forward:
Rather than inciting unions against TETFund, we should encourage constructive engagement. Key unions/stakeholders such as #ASUU , #ASUP , et.al , can:

Collaborate with TETFund to design programs that prevent abuse, such as mandatory return clauses (With more severe consequences for any breach of agreement) and post-scholarship monitoring.

Advocate for Alternative #Solutions , such as domestic scholarships with #international collaboration or short-term overseas training.

Engage with the #Government to address the exchange rate issue or increase funding for education.

This is a call for responsibility and collaboration, not confrontation. By working together, we can restore the integrity of the scholarship program and ensure it serves its original purpose, which is tailored towards advancing Nigeria‚Äôs #academic and #economic development.

Caveat:
I personally have no affiliation with TETFund or any political entity, I have not benefitted from the scholarship, so it won't be construed as a beneficiary defending his benefactor, I do not know the executive secretary from Adam, but as an academic, I believe in standing tall for what is right and feasible always.

In this episode, we had the privilege of speaking with Dr. Moses Alobo , a distinguished physician, public health expert, and social impact entrepreneur, about the critical role of African voices in driving scientific innovation. Dr. Alobo leads the Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship team at the Science for Africa Foundation , where he works tirelessly to bridge the gap between cutting-edge science and the unique needs of the African continent.

In this insightful conversation, Dr. Alobo shared his vision for a future where scientific advancements are deeply rooted in local challenges, creating solutions that resonate with the realities on the ground. He emphasized the importance of aligning innovations with market demands, highlighting how science must respond to the specific needs of African communities to truly make an impact.

üí¨ ‚ÄúWhat I would really like to do is to make sure that health innovations, scientific innovations on the African continent, are actually working towards local problems. For the longest time, our intelligent minds on the African continent have been used for science that is important for problems that are not on the African continent.‚Äù - Dr. Moses Alobo This episode offers a behind-the-scenes look at the intersection of innovation, entrepreneurship, and the urgent need to address the unique challenges faced by Africa.

Europe can no longer afford a fragmented business community. Fragmentation holds Europe back, and by uniting, business angels we can leverage competence, experience, and capital to unlock network effects, drive growth, and secure Europe‚Äôs position on the global stage

Individual investors have some influence, but as a group, business angels have immense power‚Äîperhaps the most significant untapped resource in Europe. Its a forgotten group that no one has built anything for before on their own terms.

Business angels are a critical voice for innovation, but they lack an independent organization to represent them in the media and to policymakers.

If we come together as a group, entrepreneurs will gain better access to capital. The capital is here in our region, but there‚Äôs a lack of coordination. If we solve that, entrepreneurs can focus on building their businesses instead of searching for capital in every corner of the world.

üåç I raised a few points regarding how AfCRA can help in the economic development of the African Continent: enhance the credit worthiness of our collective economies, reduce the credit rating bias that impose higher-than-normal credit risk premia, encourage the development of African domestic capital markets and foster regional integration among our collective markets in the continent. 

ü§ñ I also touched upon how AfCRA can innovate to stay ahead of evolving financial landscape such as leveraging technology and AI drive data and analysis, providing Africa-centric variables and dynamics in the analysis and create a digital platform for stakeholder engagement, among other points. These will help improve credit rating accuracy by analyzing a large quantum of economic, social and environmental data in realtime, all the while providing investors and researchers a more accurate assessment of African credit risks and dynamics. 

‚òëÔ∏è Eventually, Africa has a lot of potential and as a continent, can contribute significantly to economic development and innovation. More data driven analysis, clearer and more transparent communication and a proactive approach to controlling the narrative of our domestic economies, can make or break the economic development we so long to see happen for our lovely and dear continent #Africa #RatingAgencies #SDGs #EconomicDevelopment #FreePalestine #HandsOffLebanon #EndZionism ‚Ä¶more 116 11 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Oswald (Truthonthetrack) Hellemun oswald hellemun 10mo Report this post Rise and shine! üåû Staying humble & staying positive today.

Last night at 8 PM, I had the privilege of virtually attending the High-Level Dialogue on the Establishment of the Africa Credit Rating Agency (AfCRA) in New York. This pivotal event, organized by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), tackled the pressing issue of unfair credit ratings for African nations.

My key takeaway? The establishment of AfCRA is a game-changer, poised to unlock Africa‚Äôs true economic potential by providing fairer credit ratings. This initiative will pave the way for better access to global capital markets and lower borrowing costs, fuelling Africa‚Äôs industrialization and economic resilience.

However, a well-known challenge remains: How will AfCRA ensure its ratings are accepted and trusted by global investors and financial institutions? This question is crucial for AfCRA‚Äôs success in the realistic world. #AfCRA #EconomicGrowth #AfricaRising #FairCreditRatings #GlobalFinance 10 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Ashley E.

Instead, it was primarily set up as a tool for assimilation and control, imposing European governance structures, restricting Indigenous rights, and undermining traditional economic and social systems. This Act centralized decision-making by Canada, disempowering Indigenous communities and disconnecting them from their traditional governance and economic practices, which were deeply intertwined with their cultural and spiritual beliefs. 

To truly move towards self-determination, Indigenous communities may need to unlearn the systems imposed by the Indian Act and re-engage with their traditional ways. This involves revitalizing Indigenous legal systems and cultural practices and may include adopting modern technologies such as blockchain. Utilizing blockchain could provide transparent and secure methods for managing community resources and transactions, potentially even supporting the creation of a value-based currency that reflects Indigenous values and priorities.

We stand at a crossroads, faced with the pivotal decision of whether we will determine our own governance and governments, or allow the colonial government to continue doing so through modern treaty agreements, ‚Äúself-government‚Äù agreements and land management acts. The emergence of blockchain technology presents a transformative opportunity to not only re-establish our sovereignty but also to ensure it remains immutable and incorruptible.

By leveraging blockchain, we can create a transparent and secure foundation for our governance structures, financial systems, and communal investments. This technology allows us to protect our cultural heritage, uphold our traditional laws, and manage our resources in a way that aligns with our values and needs.

Blockchain's decentralized nature empowers us to bypass the colonial frameworks that have historically undermined our self-determination. It offers a means to build a future where our governance is truly representative of our people, and where our decisions are made free from external interference.

At Nationsfirst, we are committed to harnessing this technology to pave the way for a new era of Indigenous sovereignty.

I am Kevin Douglas. 

As I mentioned in my last interview in Duba, in my novels, I try to simplify certain concepts.
In #KALAKO for example, Blockchain was one of the most exciting concepts to demystify.

** Let us all transport ourselves in spirit to an African village. Imagine the blockchain as a parley tree, under which villagers gather to make important decisions.¬†üëÅÔ∏è
¬†
ü•ä Instead of all decisions being made by a chief, each and everyone has a say in the matter, and the decision is made together. 

üñêüèº - This is what is called ¬´¬†decentralization in blockchain¬†¬ª: everyone has a role to play and no one controls everything ! ¬¥ ‚öíÔ∏è
¬†
** Now imagine that every time a decision is made under the parley tree, it is engraved in the bark of the tree. ü¶†

‚òÇÔ∏è - This way, everyone will be able to see what has been decided and no one will be able to erase or modify the marks. This is what is called ¬´¬†immutability in blockchain¬†¬ª: once information is added, it cannot be changed.¬†üôèüèæ
¬†
** Additionally, whenever a new decision is carved into the tree, it is linked to all previous decisions. If someone tries to change a previous decision, it will affect all subsequent decisions, which will be easily noticed by everyone. 

‚öîÔ∏è - This is the ¬´¬†hash effect¬†¬ª: a function that links all the blocks together in the blockchain.¬†‚åöÔ∏è
¬†
üç© ~ Furthermore, before a decision is carved into the bark of the tree, everyone must agree. 

- This is what is called ¬´¬†blockchain consensus¬†¬ª: everyone must verify and approve a piece of¬† information before it can be added.¬†‚åõÔ∏è
¬†
** Finally, imagine that there is an oracle in this village who predicts the weather in the coming days. If his predictions come true, he receives a payment. 

üíé - This is similar to ¬´¬†proof of work¬†¬ª in blockchain, where those who solve a complex problem (like predicting the weather) are rewarded. 

** In fact, the blockchain is like a digital parley tree ü¶† ‚Ä¶ where everyone has to express themselves, where all decisions are engraved so that everyone can see them, and where everyone must give their agreement before a new decision can be made. ü•ä #Tech #A .i #KD #KALAKOTV #ADMP #DLT #Delhi #Dubai #Doha #Lubumbashi #ManUtd #LaurynHill #FashionWeek ‚Ä¶more 7 5 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Anthony Richard CEO of Universe.com | Leader | Innovator | Blockchain, Web3 and AI Technology enthusiast | Strategist | Futurist | Building for Africa 3mo Report this post We are in the last month of the year!

It has been an interesting year and we can not deny that we have a lot to say about it.

Am pleased to share that we have been finally incorporated by the Nigerian government as a company at UNIVERSE.COM under the name; 

UNIVERSE CONNECT ENTERPRISE AFRICA LTD

It was long 8 months of waiting to get this and over the course, we had to change our names three times after they had been approved.

Patience kept us because that delayed us in getting some certain things done. None the less, we are a resilient set of people and we are determined on our goals.

We are determined to contribute greatly to the growth of the African economy, this is the climax of our passion, to shape the African economy at large and to prove to the world that Africa has what it takes to live sustainably and become an economic giant of a continent through connecting and providing sustainable and inclusive solutions first to local problems and then internationally.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency is key to unlocking the new economy. Any nation determined to leverage it, is on the verge of economic breakthrough.

Not leaving AI, for now, there are few people or entities building AI, any other person else is just applying as a tool, but in a short while, we shall be showing what it means to truly build A blockchain and AI tech solutions, that is another level entirely!

Am so excited at what we can do with the right support, resources and talents. 

I am a futurist, I innovate for the future.

Marketing and Partnerships in Web3 | Brand Communications | Business Development in Web3 10mo Edited Report this post During blockchain week in Bangkok Alex Svanevik touched upon the thesis that the World Economic Forum and governments impose on us:¬†
¬†
¬´You'll own nothing and be happy¬ª.¬†
¬†
Frankly speaking, it doesn't sound optimistic for me, but in fact, it is already happening:¬†
¬†
üè†¬†There is a gradual disappointment in the real estate market for investors due to the INSECURITY OF THEIR OWN ASSETS (moratoriums on evictions, squatters, real estate confiscations etc.)

Tenants become limited in their rights and lose their RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP, and governments don't know how to deal with it. Sad truth, huh?
¬†
üíπ Your assets may simply be frozen in stock market due to circumstances beyond your control based on your citizenship.
¬†
üíµ Geopolitical issues and sanctions directly limit banking operations for regular users.

OPPORTUNITIES BECOME LIMITED IN THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM.

I like how Alex explained the vision of Nansen and the whole crypto world in general: 

¬´I want us to work towards the world where people are ACTUAL OWNERS, and have access to the upside of these assets, which become more valuable¬ª. 

Indeed, there are incredible distribution and resources behind the chains and applications based on blockchain. Blockchain networks and apps have remarkable distributions and resources. Cutting-edge solutions in NFT allow holders to contribute to value generation and connect with the Web3 community, and even more is yet to come.

Blockchain is often described as a digital ledger, but it's much more than that due to its decentralized, secure, and transparent nature.   
üìåThe trinity of writing, money, and ledgers allowed human beings to do business beyond kinship groups

üìåThe advent of the first ledger technology can be traced back to roughly 3000 BCE, in ancient Mesopotamia(modern-day Iraq). Of the tens of thousands of clay tablets the Mesopotamians left behind, most are, well, ledger :  records of taxes,
payments,private wealth, worker pay

""ùëæùíâùíö ùë©ùíçùíêùíÑùíåùíÑùíâùíÇùíäùíè ùíäùíî ùë≠ùíÇùíì ùë¥ùíêùíìùíÜ ùëªùíâùíÇùíè ùë±ùíñùíîùíï ùíÇ ùë≠ùíÇùíèùíÑùíö ùë≥ùíÜùíÖùíàùíÜùíì""
exchanges of goods and services have defined the expansion of societies, but this was possible `only if people could keep track of exchanges. it was not so difficult for everyone in a small village to remember that someone had killed a pig and to TRUST that whoever all ate of it would find some way to later repay the hunter perhaps with a new arrowhead or some other thing of value.

It was another to manage these cross-societies obligations across the larger group. of especially when moving outside of kinship boundaries made it harder to trust each other.

The Constitution allocates specific powers to both, allowing states to cater to regional needs while ensuring national unity. However, political bargaining and regional demands can sometimes challenge this balance, just as we see with the tension between centralization and decentralization in the tech world.

In tech, decentralization, such as with blockchain, empowers individual nodes or systems to function independently while maintaining security and transparency across the network. This is similar to how states operate in a federal system: they have the autonomy to address local issues but are part of the larger national framework. Decentralization fosters innovation, resilience, and responsiveness, allowing each unit to adapt to its unique context.

The key, both in governance and tech, is finding the right balance. The strength lies in decentralization‚Äôs ability to innovate and adapt, while also ensuring coordination and unity in a larger system. #Federalism #Innovation #Politics #BalanceofPower #Technology #Decentralization 13 Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Ivan B. Linde Sustainability Technology Liaison | Open to GREAT Collaboration Opportunities | Open Networker LION 5mo Report this post ### Tether's Bold Move: Boron-Backed Tokens in Turkey 

In an ambitious effort to integrate blockchain technology beyond traditional uses, Tether has approached the Turkish government with a cutting-edge proposal: digital tokens backed by boron. This initiative reflects Tether's aim to extend its stablecoin influence, exploring the utility of natural resources like boron in stabilizing digital currencies. By leveraging blockchain, Tether seeks to offer a transparent and efficient system that taps into Turkey's boron-rich reserves, potentially revolutionizing how value is transferred and stored.

The collaboration with Turkey underscores the company's strategic vision to innovate in the stablecoin market by exploring unique asset-backing options. Tether envisions this partnership as a path to both strengthen the digital currency ecosystem in Turkey and present a model that could be replicated globally. The utilization of boron, a high-demand mineral with diverse applications, underlines a commitment to sustainability and resource-backed financial solutions.

This proposal comes at a time when countries are increasingly exploring digital currencies' potential to reshape their financial landscapes. If realized, Tether‚Äôs boron-backed tokens could offer Turkey a robust new vehicle for economic development, securing a future where digital and physical assets coalesce seamlessly.

It‚Äôs been just over a year since I joined NODO to report on Africa‚Äôs expanding blockchain ecosystem, a role I found to be deeply connected to as my work evolved from an African focus to a global lens on decentralised technologies. 

Today, I manage content for the company, and while my day-to-day involves less journalism‚Äîmy forte at TechCabal ‚ÄîI feel proud to be contributing to the important work we‚Äôre doing in making DeFi more accessible for global users.

it‚Äôs a solution born out of necessity. 

in sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional financial systems are unreliable, Agridex steps in to tokenize agricultural trades üåç.

as Henry Duckworth, Agridex‚Äôs CEO, mentioned, ‚Äúnormally what happens is you have to be your own banker, your own trader, and your own lawyer.‚Äù 

this burden falls heavily on small-scale farmers, and Agridex aims to change that.

what truly stands out is how Agridex uses NFTs to secure trades. 

each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it transparent and tamper-proof üîç. Parrogate , one of their partners, noted they could cut transaction costs from several percentage points to just 0.75%. 

this would really help create trust in an industry that desperately needs it.

Agridex‚Äôs model also highlights a broader trend: blockchain is becoming essential for industries dealing with real-world goods üöú.

as Duckworth pointed out, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not seen as somebody who‚Äôs gonna aggregate and sell out data points and manipulate other people‚Äôs positions.‚Äù 

at MC¬≤ Finance , we‚Äôre inspired by innovations like this. 

they remind us that the power of blockchain lies in solving real problems üìà. 19 4 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 465 followers View Profile Follow More from this author The Convergence of Regulation, Technology, Investment, and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) for Indigenous Nations Nationsfirst 1w How Nationsfirst is Redefining Indigenous Economic Empowerment Nationsfirst 2mo Revolutionizing Fundraising: Empowering Indigenous Businesses, Organizations, and Communities with Blockchain Technology Nationsfirst 8mo Explore topics Sales Marketing IT Services Business Administration HR Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn ¬© 2025 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (Arabic) ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ (Bangla) ƒåe≈°tina (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Greek) English (English) Espa√±ol (Spanish) ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å (Persian) Suomi (Finnish) Fran√ßais (French) ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (Hindi) Magyar (Hungarian) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™ (Hebrew) Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese) ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (Korean) ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡•Ä (Marathi) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) ‡®™‡©∞‡®ú‡®æ‡®¨‡©Ä (Punjabi) Polski (Polish) Portugu√™s (Portuguese) Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian) –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å (Telugu) ‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) T√ºrk√ße (Turkish) –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (Ukrainian) Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese) ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Simplified)) Ê≠£È´î‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese (Traditional)) Language Sign in to view more content Create your free account or sign in to continue your search Sign in Welcome back Email or phone Password Show Forgot password?

EF-Tu \(elongation factor thermo unstable\) is a prokaryotic elongation factor responsible for catalyzing the binding of an aminoacyl-tRNA \(aa-tRNA\) to the ribosome. It is a G-protein, and facilitates the selection and binding of an aa-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome. As a reflection of its crucial role in translation, EF-Tu is one of the most abundant and highly conserved proteins in prokaryotes.

Skip to main content LinkedIn Articles People Learning Jobs Games Join now Sign in Jen Newsted‚Äôs Post Jen Newsted Activating Social Impact & Reconciliation Commitments | Independent Contractor | Settler Disrupting The Status Quo 6mo Report this post Friends, and especially those in, around, or with connection to Winnipeg- are you registered for the upcoming Indigenomics SHE conference taking place September 23 & 24 yet?

The reason I ask is because I get lots of asks from folks looking for connections or introductions to Indigenous folks that I might know. 

Here's the secret to you skipping the step of having to ask me who I know: Activate your reconciliation commitments by intentionally prioritizing getting yourself into spaces that are Indigenous led so that YOU are in fact doing the work to meet, connect, cultivate relationships with Indigenous leaders and businesses. 

The learning that comes from being in Indigenous led spaces, like the annual events the Indigenomics Institute hosts, are phenomenally rich and imperative for our reconciliation responsibility. But you know this because I have been telling you which is why you are reaching out to me. Remember this is our shared responsibility.

Indigenomics SHE has 40 Indigenous leaders who will share their insights, experiences, challenges, successes in government, law, finance, tech, education, communications, fashion, art, tourism, culinary, corporate canada, entrepreneurism.

The conference will be hosted and emceed again this year by three epic humans who are shining brightly in the image from last year's SHE conference. Carol Anne Hilton, MBA, ICD.D , CEO and founder of Indigenomics Institute, Global Centre of Indigenomics & the Global Indigenous Technology House, Ashley Richard Director, Indigenous Entrepreneurship University of Waterloo and Diane Roussin BA, BSW, M.S.M. ü¶¶ Project Director, The Winnipeg Boldness Project.

Keynotes are from Laurie Sterritt Managing Partner Pathways Executive Search and Victoria LaBillois, MBA owner of Wejipeg Excavation and founder Eloquent Hostess. 

Additionally, in the room are representatives from Women Entrepreneurship Knowledge Hub (WEKH) , TELUS , Vancity , Alliance Trust Company, Calgary, Canada , BFL CANADA , RBC and Scotiabank who are all actively contributing to #Indigenomics as partners and sponsors.

Reconciliation is about relationships and relationships do not happen in documents collecting dust. Please get in this room AND bring your c-suite, your board members, your teams, your clients because my goodness the opportunities that we have to actually show up in reconciliation are abundant - shift status quo behaviour so you stop being the barrier of why you/your company's reconciliation isn't progressing. 

If you can't physically be there you can still contribute by committing to an Accessibility package that will allow for Indigenous folks to participate on your behalf. This is also how we start to cultivate relationships. 

Finally, here's another super simple way to action reconciliation: Copy the link below and put it in your newsletters. It isn't difficult friends, unless we make it.

Your point about actively placing ourselves in Indigenous-led spaces resonates deeply. Did you know that Indigenous businesses contribute over $30 billion to Canada‚Äôs economy annually, and yet, so much more can be achieved through genuine relationships and collaborations? The opportunity to learn from 40 incredible Indigenous leaders across diverse sectors is invaluable. üí°

I encourage everyone to show up, bring their teams, and commit to truly shifting the status quo.

I‚Äôm excited to share that I‚Äôm co-organizing a few unique events in the first half of 2025!

ü§ù To be honest, I usually ùò©ùò¢ùòµùò¶ traditional conferences‚Äîthey‚Äôre often poorly curated, overly formal, and feel like everyone‚Äôs just trying to extract value from each other. Life‚Äôs too short for that, so I decided to create the kind of gatherings that bring people together in a meaningful, exciting way.

üóìÔ∏è Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming up:
¬†‚Ä¢ ùó£ùóÆùóøùó∏ ùóñùó∂ùòÅùòÜ, ùó®ùòÅùóÆùóµ (ùóôùó≤ùóØ ùüÆùü≥ - ùó†ùóÆùóø ùüÆ): A retreat for successful entrepreneurs and investors. I‚Äôm partnering with my friend Noah Berkson to host an event that combines deep conversations, outdoor adventures, and genuine connection.
‚Ä¢¬†ùó£ùóÆùóπùó∫ ùóóùó≤ùòÄùó≤ùóøùòÅ, ùóñùóî (ùóîùóΩùóøùó∂ùóπ ùüÆ-ùü∞): A retreat for 100 badass female founders, organized with my friends Mada Seghete and Emily Dong . Mada‚Äôs event last year was wildly successful, and we‚Äôre building on that energy with the community we‚Äôve fostered through Badass Female Founders.

üåé I‚Äôm also in the early stages of organizing a trip to the Bahamas for some of the world‚Äôs boldest scientists‚Äîthose who are truly iconoclastic and have a shot at changing the world. This all-expenses-paid gathering will include Nobel Prize winners, the brilliant Michael Levin (known for his groundbreaking work on bioelectricity and regrowing limbs), and other incredible minds working on transformative ideas. If you‚Äôre interested in helping fund bold bio research, I‚Äôd love to keep you posted about this trip!

üåü Why am I doing all of this? Because these events enrich my life. They create opportunities for meaningful relationships, unexpected collaborations, and ideas that can genuinely change the trajectory of lives and industries. And selfishly, they‚Äôre also a chance for me to connect with people I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to drop in with yet.

If any of this speaks to you, let me know in the comments‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to have you join us on this journey. 108 46 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Candida Bongini 5mo Edited Report this post Associations today are facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities.

I help navigate complex conversations, decision-making & collaboration. 

Passionate and writing about inclusion, power dynamics, regenerative cultures, community & change-making 7mo Edited Report this post üåç Exciting news: I'll join the Gathering Of Tribes in Portugal from September 11th to 15th! This event brings together regenerative entrepreneurs, change-makers, activists, and community builders across ecosystems for a co-created experience where we connect, learn from each other, and build community across different initiatives. Initially, I had some reservations (the use of ""tribes"" did raise a few questions...). However, this event genuinely seems to be a space where regenerators want to share, learn, and remember that we‚Äôre working towards the same goals and cooperation is the way. ü§ùüå±

As part of my participation, I‚Äôve chosen to join Claudia Marras at the CoPartnerUp camp, where I‚Äôll be offering workshops on facilitation, to help participants enhance their power to foster collaboration and co-creation in their teams. I was drawn to this camp because of its focus on fostering meaningful collaborations and partnerships‚Äîareas that are deeply aligned with my work at Moving Mindsets Facilitation . üí¨‚ú®

‚ö°Ô∏è My intention in joining the Gathering goes beyond simply connecting and collaborating. By co-creating a global community of changemakers and facilitators, we can contribute to building a culture of care, genuine transformation, and collective liberation‚Äîall while recognizing the deep disparities that exist in our world, perpetuated by structural barriers and systems of oppression. This collaborative (and often privileged) work must aim not only for greater equity but also for dismantling the oppressive structures that continue to perpetuate injustice. ‚úä

üì£ If you're coming or want to know more about the Gathering (or join me at CoPartnerUp camp), feel free to message me! Let‚Äôs connect, share ideas, and work together towards collective liberation and a culture of care for ourselves, each other, and the planet. üåø‚ù§Ô∏è #GatheringOfTribes #Regeneration #CoCreation #Facilitation #Collaboration #CollectiveLiberation #Care #SocialJustice #Sustainability #Changemakers 19 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in World MAP [Meaning&Purpose Summit] 54 followers 3mo Report this post The World Meaning and Purpose Summit is more than just an event‚Äîit is a movement.

A movement to inspire concrete actions that transform not only our own lives but also our communities and the world around us. This is a call to those who believe that the future belongs to those who dare to live and lead with purpose.

In a world facing a crisis of meaning, many individuals who believe in and dedicate their lives to bringing purpose into the world often feel isolated. Despite their passion and commitment, we can frequently find ourselves navigating this journey alone, feeling the weight of a world that doesn‚Äôt always prioritize purpose and meaning.

At the World Meaning and Purpose Summit, we aim to change that. By connecting globally, we create a powerful network of like-minded individuals who share a common vision of a more purposeful world. Together, we will build a community that offers support, encouragement, and inspiration, reminding each of us of our unique calling and the impact we are meant to make.

We believe that by fostering meaningful dialogue, creating connections, and encouraging actionable insights, we can empower individuals and organizations to lead with authenticity, resilience, and purpose. 4 1 Comment Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in Nanaimo Prosperity Corporation 812 followers 6mo Report this post The Summit You Can‚Äôt Afford to Miss

Lucas highlighted a critical insight: ‚ÄúTo transform the system companies understand that they must work in a collective way.‚Äù ü§ù B Lab Spain is paving the way for this transformation by creating spaces where diverse organisations can come together, connect with key stakeholders, and collaboratively drive change for #Health and the #Planet ‚Äî both environmentally and socially. üå±

One standout initiative is Barcelona + B‚Äîan alliance of businesses, educational institutions, the public sector, social and cultural entities. This alliance exemplifies Lucas and his team‚Äôs ambitious vision for a more interdisciplinary approach to tackling global challenges. üåê

However, as Lucas pointed out, ‚ÄúThe biggest challenge we are facing as a movement is to settle the expectation between times.‚Äù‚è≥ The public sector often moves slowly, taking years to implement regulations, which can be a significant hurdle for private sector initiatives. Yet, it's through these challenges that innovation thrives, as both sectors learn to work together more effectively.

üåç Summit of the Future on 22-23 September in New York. Find out more about the event at https://lnkd.in/gfqeZHi9 üåç What is the Summit of the Future?
The Summit is a high-level event, bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future.

ü§ù Effective global cooperation is increasingly critical to our survival but difficult to achieve in an atmosphere of mistrust, using outdated structures that no longer reflect today‚Äôs political and economic realities.

üåü This once-in-a-generation opportunity serves as a raise the profile of neurodiversity and demonstrate that international cooperation can effectively achieve agreed goals, tackle emerging threats, and seek new opportunities.

Why the Summit matters
üîÑ The speed and complexity of developments have outpaced our systems for cooperating and coping.

üåç The benefits and opportunities of progress are spread unevenly, with the majority of people left behind.

‚ö†Ô∏è The risks and threats are also unevenly felt, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable.

üåê Multilateral governance, designed in simpler, slower times, is not adequate to today‚Äôs complex, interconnected, rapidly changing world.

‚ú® The Summit is an opportunity to take the next steps towards neuroinclusion. 

ION received special accreditation to attend in person as one of the only neurodiversity-focused civil society organisations. Kim Shah , Country Lead of the Institute of Neurodiversity ION Canada , and our Global Lead Silvan Ruthenberg (üîñ) will be representing our members, advocating for our #humanrights and #neuroinclusion globally.

ü§ù We hope to forge many new connections, partnerships, and alliances to jointly create a more inclusive and sustainable world!

I‚Äôm honoured to be speaking at the SEADE R&I Summit, hosted at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC). 

This summit brings together visionaries, innovators, and decision-makers from Europe and Africa to tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our time‚Äîclimate tech, digital transformation, and sustainable development.

Why am I so passionate about this? Because Africa has an extraordinary opportunity to redefine its place in the global innovation ecosystem. 

This isn‚Äôt just about participating‚Äîit‚Äôs about leading. 

With the right collaboration and investment, we can shape solutions that not only uplift Africa but also contribute to a more interconnected and sustainable global society.

The SEADE R&I Summit is unique because it unites some of the smartest minds to understand how we move forward together as a global society. 

It‚Äôs not just about conversations; it‚Äôs about creating actionable steps to bridge the innovation gap between continents.

I‚Äôd love for you to reflect on these questions:

1. What does the future of climate tech and digital transformation look like when Europe and Africa collaborate?

2. How can we better position Africa‚Äôs talent and resources to shape global solutions?

If you‚Äôre passionate about these topics or simply curious about what‚Äôs possible when innovation knows no borders, I invite you to join the conversation.

This event is hosted in collaboration with Post Growth Expert Melanie Rieback ( University of Amsterdam ) and Generous Minds . üôå 

Infinite growth is not possible on a planet with limited resources. We are all aware of the problems our traditional economic system leads to. Post Growth is not anti-growth. It is about rethinking what kind of growth we need for a thriving future. For example, we need more growth of renewable energy, but we need less excessive growth in waste or luxury goods. üìä Generous Minds organizes this event because not many people are yet aware of the opportunities and challenges Post Growth brings for companies, financiers, and expertsüí°

ùóîùóØùóºùòÇùòÅ ùòÜùóºùòÇ:
üëâ Are you an impact-driven entrepreneur curious to explore if Post Growth can create opportunities for your impact and business growth?
üëâ Are you a professional working in an SME, eager to understand how Post Growth could benefit your organization?
üëâ Are you a financier or investor wanting to learn about Post Growth and its implications for your current or future investments?
 üëâ Are you an expert supporting or collaborating with impact-driven companies, seeking a clear, pragmatic explanation of Post Growth?

ùóßùóµùó≤ùóª ùó∑ùóºùó∂ùóª ùòÇùòÄ! We‚Äôll have a dynamic program featuring presentations, group discussions, and plenty of networking opportunities.

The hospitality is always exceptional, and I love connecting with other founders, investors, and VCs within the local ecosystem.

One of the standout moments for me was during the keynote talks, where Martin Basiri shared profound insights on leadership. He spoke with such vulnerability about how being a founder means leading with your heart. His words resonated deeply when he said, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not fixing a problem, I‚Äôm not satisfied"" after joyfully poking fun ""I wouldn‚Äôt be happy sitting on a beach.‚Äù It was funny, relatable, and a perfect reflection of the passion that drives founders and their crazy dreams.

This year was particularly special, as I had the chance to connect with incredible people like Forbes journalist Monique Danao, share moments with The Firehood who I pitched to last year when my company was only a few weeks old, and they honoured how far Pyralume has come. It was my first time pitching it last year when I approached Simon Constantineau at Inovia Capital who said his minimum cheque is 1 million. Maybe I was just a little early. üòâ

 Always a great time with Suzanne Grant, CD and seeing Jennifer Batley üíï I love exploring new opportunities & partnerships with other founders & industry professionals. I even met inspiring women from my hometown in Muskoka, like Lauren Valliere , who‚Äôs making waves in Fintech that I'm meeting with later today üêù

These gatherings are so much more than conferences to me‚Äîthey're opportunities to share stories, learn from each other, and strengthen both new and old relationships. For me, SAAS NORTH isn‚Äôt just an event; it‚Äôs a place where magic  happens ‚ú®Ô∏è 44 10 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in 2,136 followers 656 Posts 1 Article View Profile Connect More from this author An invitation: support & celebrate empowerment of women in Vancouver.

Facilitation of community engagement on systems changes and service management is an encouragement to discuss equity economic growth, social and health services, and rights to education.

A human centered collective that values and acknowledges knowledge pathways and awareness of policies that support Indigenous authorities on language, stewardship, and historic knowledge.

What does the ‚Äúcustomer journey‚Äù look like in accessing resources?

I have faced this time and time again. People in a financial authority saying that becauwe I‚Äôm Indigenous I have access to so many resources and benefits, yet the journey to access those is so beyond ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. It‚Äôs discouraging and disappointing. 

My work is centred around the journey of accessing whatever it is that the person or business is striving towards. 

A plan, goal, or vision is wonderful but the steps in that journey need to be clear and simple. Otherwise we are walking in place; no change.

This milestone represents our shared effort to shift the economic paradigm towards reconciliation, love and healing and I am deeply honoured to be on that journey with our team at Raven Capital, with each of our investors, and with all the incredible Indigenous Founders that we invest in.  By working together, we are implementing Article 3 of the UN DRIP and we are implementing the spirit and intent of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action.  Deepest gratitude.

TELUS Pollinator Fund for Good #reconciliation #Indigenomics #investments #indigenousbusiness Raven Indigenous Capital Partners 10,107 followers 2y Edited Raven Indigenous Capital Partners is excited to announce the final closing of a historic $100M (CAD) Indigenous venture capital fund to support Indigenous and Native American entrepreneurs. This fund addresses critical gaps in the Indigenous finance ecosystem and provides a culturally grounded approach to investing. 

The closing of this fund is a critical inflection point for both Indigenous Peoples and impact investing that highlights the positive state and growth of the Indigenous economy. Indigenous and Native American entrepreneurs are rightfully taking their place at the forefront of the economy. 

Backed by some of North America's most prominent foundations and financial institutions, Fund II will build on the success of Fund I to invest exclusively in Indigenous and Native American enterprises that demonstrate commercial viability, potential for scale, and measurable community benefit streams. ‚ÄúOur hands are raised in gratitude to all our Fund II investors. This is economic reconciliation in action and an implementation of Article 3 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,‚Äù said Paul Lacerte, Managing Partner and Chief Impact Officer, Raven Indigenous Capital Partners. 

‚ÄúBy providing the capital and the support that Indigenous entrepreneurs require to succeed, we will continue to build innovative and resilient Indigenous economies that are good for our People and good for the planet.‚Äù Jeff Cyr, Managing Partner for Raven Capital and CEO of the Raven Indigenous Impact Foundation. #Indigenousbusiness #Nativeamerican #Nativeamericanbusiness #impactinvesting 56 6 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Seth Asimakos Social Entrepreneur 2y Report this comment Awesome to hear.

We worked together 20 years ago with Aboriginal Business Canada and now we work together administering and growing this program and network. Over the last number of years we introduced a market ready Indigenous Growth Fund, a Women's program, renewed AEP support, rolled out Covid business supports, solidified the Indigenous Prosperity Forum¬† (one of the most impactful events in Canada), added 500M in programming - which will lead to positive socioeconomic impacts for our communities. One dollar added, in turn multiplies back into the whole economy.¬† Thank you Gerry, Thank you to your powerhouse of a fianc√© Kim, and the entire NACCA team, network and board for your contribution to bettering society as a whole and making Indigenous Prosperity a reality.

Indigeno Travel 638 followers 2y We're thrilled to announce that Dennis Meeches, former longtime Chief of Long Plain First Nation, and more recently the chief spokesperson for the seven First Nations of Treaty One, has accepted the position of Chair of the Board of Directors of Indigeno Travel.

Shaking things up. Investing in circular economies. 2y Edited Report this post Thank you to all the folks at Snowline Gold Corp. (CSE:SGD)(OTC:SNWGF) and Solvest Inc who helped make this happen with us. Special thanks to Ben Power , Scott Berdahl , Steve Rennalls , and Kara Kolkman for bringing all your creativity to the table on this file and making space for greener solutions at remote exploration sites via investments and innovation from Indigenous businesses.

This project was supported with funding from Yukon Development Corporation and Northern REACHE, under the Office of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations #greeneconomy #indigenomics #mineralexploration Na-Cho Ny√§k Dun Development Corporation 890 followers 2y NACHO NYAK DUN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION ANNOUNCES AN AGREEMENT WITH SNOWLINE GOLD TO POWER MAIN CAMP WITH A LARGE-SCALE SOLAR GENERATOR

TUESDAY, AUGUST 2, 2022 ‚Äì MAYO, YUKON: The Nacho Nyak Dun Development Corporation (NNDDC) has entered into a 5-year agreement with Snowline Gold Corp. (CSE:SGD)(OTC:SNWGF) (Snowline) to lease a 27-kilowatt portable solar generator system for Snowline‚Äôs exploration project in the Selwyn Basin. This project is located within the Traditional Territory of the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun (FNNND). This investment will help reduce carbon emissions and provide economic benefits within the green economy.
This solar generator, which was designed and built by Solvest Inc and is one of the first of its kind in the Yukon, will be used to power Snowline‚Äôs off-grid 45-person ""Forks‚Äù camp on its Rogue Project in the Eastern Yukon. Estimates provided by Solvest, based on data collected from Snowline‚Äôs 2021 field program, predict the new solar generator will have estimated total fuel savings per season of 12,572L of diesel and reduce the camp‚Äôs direct diesel consumption by up to 90% for the season. Not only does this project help to reduce direct consumption, but also reduces the indirect fuel consumption required to transport fuel to the site, which includes trucking fuel to Mayo and then to the site via airplane. This will have a net positive impact on the project from an environmental and financial perspective.

‚ÄúInvestments such as this are examples of how Indigenous businesses are leading the way in accelerating the green economy, and innovations such as this provide opportunities for such entities to become increasingly engaged in the mineral resource sector. We see this investment as just the first of many of its kind and we are working towards building a fleet that can be deployed throughout the Traditional Territory.‚Äù - Jani Djokic (she/her) , CEO, NNDDC

The system consists of 3 main components: the power module, the battery module and the solar panel module. The size of the system was based on data collected during the 2021 exploration season. The system reduces the generator operating time and fuel consumption. Reduced operating time for the generator allows camp noise to be reduced, creating a better quality of life for employees due to the reduction of noise pollution. The reduction in sound is also expected to have a positive impact on the wildlife in the surrounding areas. Installation of the solar generator is complete, and the system is now fully operational, providing a majority of the camp‚Äôs power.

""This project is a tangible representation of how Snowline is realizing our Corporate Vision. It increases efficiency while creating financial and environmental value. It improves our employees' work environment, it is yet another partnership with the NNDDC, and it is being provided by Solvest, one of Yukon's most innovative companies."" - Steve Rennalls , Operations Manager, Snowline #greeneconomy #indigenomics 41 4 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Vidya Vankayala 2y Report this comment Very inspiring outcome, glad to see large scale solar project like this happen Like Reply 1¬†Reaction Michael Bakaic üß≤ Cyber Lead Magnets for MSPs | Founder @ Iceberg Cyber üßä 2y Report this comment üëè Like Reply 1¬†Reaction Matthew Simard Pre-Construction | Sustainability | VDC 2y Report this comment Awesome work!
